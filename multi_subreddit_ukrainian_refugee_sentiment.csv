Is anyone else worried about how effective this anti Poland and Ukraine propaganda is online?,"Every mention of refugees in western media is met with ""but Poland is racist and isn't letting black people or Muslims or Indians"". We have let in by far the most people from the conflict and we clearly have no problem doing so. This pro invasion propaganda that's spread to divide us is very effective.

Question About Driver's License for a Refugee in Poland,"First of all, thank you all for your ongoing support! Ukraine really appreciates all of it! 

OK, on to this day's headache. My wife is freaking out, lol. Her driver's license was given to her when we had a different transliteration rule in Ukraine. So her name in English on the license had one letter at the start. But then the transliteration changed in mid 2010s. And her passport that she received after the license now has a different letter at the start. So, the license, as an example, says ""Gabby"" and the passport says ""Habby"".

Literally everything else is the same, the rest of her name, last name (she didn't change her's when we got married), birthday dates and all that. It's. Just. One. Letter. At the start of her name. 

I'm in Ukraine, she and the kid are in Poland. Someone told her that she might get in trouble because of this in Poland. Now, she wants to come back to Kyiv and change her driver's license just because of that one letter. She wants to take a multi-day trip back into the war zone just to change one letter in her driver's license. Mind you, everything else is identical in Cyrillic - no changes there. So it's just two different letters in the English version of her first name on the license and on the passport.

* The question is: **can she really get in trouble in Poland because of this one letter?** 

Sorry for a weird question. Last thing I want is for them to come back right now. The UA embassy in Poland did have this service, but it's not available ever since the war started and is not going to be at least until autumn.

Renting flats only to people with polish nationality? What do you guys think about this?,"I'm currently looking to rent an apartment and many listings require the new tenents to be of polish citizenship(or nationality).

What do you guys think about this?

Me personal, I am absolutely disgusted by this. And absolutely nothing justifies this kind of chauvinism. Especially now!

I lived half of my life as an expat myself in Germany and know how it's like to be second class citizen.

And I also cannot imagine that anybody in Berlin would dare to write ""we rent only to people of german citizenship"". Such a landlord would be stoned to death as an Ubernazi.

Do we really want Poland to be such a place? Is this our culture? Can we be proud of having hosted 3 millions war refugees from Ukraine and at the same time tolerate ""we rent only to people of polish citizenship""?

My personal belief is that from an ideological and cultural pov this is unacceptable and I feel deeply ashamed that I see so many of these offers - this shows the scale of chauvinism in Poland. If anything at all then polish people should be discriminated and the listings should be like ""people from Ukraine preferred and a special price for them"".

Please don't come up with the poor landlord who has to pay his super high mortgage and is in a difficult situation. This is still chauvinism, nationalism and discrimination.

How to reason with racist aunt?,"Hello, I have a Polish aunt who is staunchly against Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees.

Warsaw is losing its patience and gradually turning away from Ukraine,"Poland is one of the closest neighbors of Ukrainian state and one of the ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù for Ukrainian President Zelensky. From the beginning of war in Ukraine Warsaw has supported the neighbor country with everything necessary (weapons, humanitarian aid, weapons and even mercenaries). But today the situation is quiet different.  

A close and large shadow slipped between the two friends comparable to night. Problems in relations between Kiev and Warsaw began last year and were connected to a great number of Ukrainian refugees who had flee their country with the beginning of war. A great number of those people got to Poland to receive social benefits and free housing. Some of them did not want to follow local rules and to accept local way of life.  

This year Polish President Andrzej Duda announced a protectionist policy towards  local farmers and banned the import of Ukrainian agricultural products for sale on the territory of his country. Such a measure was also supported by some other European countries. Zelensky, naturally, was offended by his neighbor and is now trying to file a complaint with an international court to lift the restrictions. The EU government announced the the total support to Warsaw with this issue.

The peak of tension between Zelensky and Duda was the invitation to the Canadian House of Commons of a Ukrainian veteran of the SS troops, or, to be more precise, a former soldier of the fascist SS division ‚ÄúGalicia‚Äù which had participated in the extermination of Poles and Jews. The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invited the former Ukrainian fascist and real criminal Jaroslav Gunko to the Parliament to attend Zelensky‚Äôs speech. At the end of the Ukrainian President‚Äôs speech the whole hall applauded Gunko. It was the last straw of patience for the Poles.

Polish Ambassador to Ottawa Witold Dzielski said he expects an official apology for inviting a Nazi collaborator to the Canadian Parliament. Then Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland said that the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada should resign after the scandal with honoring a Ukrainian who fought as part of the SS division. At the same time, Mularczyk added that the lack of unequivocal condemnation of the SS soldiers and their glorification ‚Äúis a big compromise‚Äù.

As the result of all those problems in relations between both countries Duda said that Poland would not conclude new military contracts with Ukraine. According to him, Kiev will only receive military equipment from the contracts which were concluded earlier.

LONG READ: In big-hearted Poland they hate only one man: the new Hitler,"Matthew Syed - The Times 

Across the expanse of the railway station I am drawn to him, sitting on a bench among dozens of other Ukrainian refugees. Perhaps it is something in his eyes, tired but defiant, or perhaps it is the sight of his younger brother weeping as his mother sleeps fitfully after a journey of indeterminate length. The boy beckons. ‚ÄúI can speak English a little,‚Äù he whispers. ‚ÄúMy name is Oleksandr. Would you like to talk to me?‚Äù

I am in the Polish border town of Przemysl, and, to be frank, I am struggling to take it all in. It is a daunting privilege to witness the scenes of refugees huddling together in the cold, eyes haunted, bodies exhausted, fathers and husbands left behind to face pitiless bombing.

I am here to see the dynamics of this refugee crisis, but also the role of Poland. It is a nation that has been viewed as a backslider from western values, a nation that abhors immigrants, a country that symbolises the crisis in liberalism. The longer I stay here, though, the more I detect the myopia of this narrative, pushed by supposedly more enlightened EU partners like Germany and France.

But let me return to Oleksandr, a little Ukrainian boy with a huge heart. His arms are around his brother as he speaks, in faltering English, not about his own suffering but about the responsibility he feels for his mother and sibling ‚Äî he is but 12 years old. ‚ÄúWe travelled for three days and wondered if we would be killed by the airplanes,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt want to leave [Ukraine](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/ukraine?page=1). I wanted to fight Putin with Papa.‚Äù His mother, roused from her slumber, hugs him tight, a grown-up before his time.

I move across the concourse of the neo-baroque station, beautiful paintings above, misery down below. I speak to Tatiana and her four children, whose home in the Donbas region was shaken by aerial bombardment and who huddled in a basement for two weeks, cold, frightened, hungry. I speak to Maria from Kharkiv, who journeyed for six days to escape Putin‚Äôs hell, with her six-year-old daughter Anna.

 When I ask how they coped, she shows me a picture her daughter has drawn. It is a large smiley face, an image they look at whenever they feel frightened about the fate of the husband and father left behind. ‚ÄúThe picture makes us feel happy and safe,‚Äù she says quietly.

With each story, a new pixel emerges in the panorama of Putin‚Äôs unprovoked war, a new insight into its iniquity. In a narrow corridor I speak to Louisa, a grandmother whose memories reach back to the Second World War, sitting beside her daughter, Andzela, who is in a wheelchair after a stroke three years ago, and two grandchildren. She is a retired chef and talks proudly of her speciality of rice, meat, grated carrots and onions. You can see her strength, her warmth, her wide brown eyes projecting into my heart. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to leave our home,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe wanted to defy Putin. But we will not surrender; our men will keep going till the end.‚Äù

 And this mention of Putin hints at perhaps the most salient factor in this border town. Rich and poor, Polish and Ukrainian, relief workers and police officers, all are united in one visceral emotion. They hate the Russian leader. They do so with such feeling that many recoil when I mention his name. The hatred is not directed against the Russian people but against Putin himself: the man whose psychopathy led to this conflagration and the greatest European migration crisis since the Second World War.

‚ÄúI am Russian by descent but I want to kill Putin,‚Äù says Anna, holding the hand of her daughter. ‚ÄúI feel guilty to use these words. But when you think of what he has done, the lies he tells his own people, the innocent people he is willing to kill, can you blame me? I have a friend who has died. My husband is still there. He calls himself president but he is the new Hitler.‚Äù

 The east of Poland is a landscape of rolling hills, scattered hamlets and smallholdings. I drive uphill to the border crossing at Kroscienko and note again the jarring contrast between the beautiful terrain and the tragedy contained in snaking lines of women and children heaving rucksacks and bags. From my vantage point above the holding centre I see a hive of activity as children eat soup served from large cylindrical containers warmed by naked flames, and their mothers ask for information about what bus will take them to their temporary homes.

From here, the idea that Poland is an unwelcoming nation seems more than a little jarring. It is true that it pushed back against the EU relocation scheme for Syrians fleeing conflict in 2015, hinting at a suspicion of multiculturalism and what many younger Poles tell me is a lingering bigotry against non-whites. But the arms thrown around two million Ukrainian refugees is nevertheless moving to behold, not least given the growing strain on public services, particularly around Warsaw.

 Anna, an engineer who repairs computers in Przemysl, has a family staying in her spare room and would happily take more. Lucian, in his twenties, has already offered to take another refugee, despite having three in his small flat. ‚ÄúYou do what you can for these brave people,‚Äù he says.

At the holding centre in a former shopping arcade I see dozens more volunteers, many willing to drive refugees across Europe to reunite them with friends or family. I am reminded of the words of the Anglican preacher Henry Melvill. ‚ÄúA thousand fibres connect us with our fellow men; and among those fibres, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects.‚Äù

 And this is where I glimpse a different narrative from the one that has emanated from Berlin and Paris: a story of Poland not as a backslider from western values but a defender of them. For was Poland not right to call for more robust sanctions against Russia after the annexation of Crimea? Was it not wise to protest against German dependence on Russian gas? Was it not justified in shuddering as EU powers continued to send weaponry to a man who had levelled Grozny and Aleppo, even after the arms embargo of 2014?

On this last point, the Investigate Europe project has found that EU countries supplied Russia with ‚Ç¨346 million of military equipment, including missiles, aircraft, rockets, torpedoes and bombs, between 2015 and 2020: weapons now being used to wreak devastation. Germany and France were the worst offenders, exploiting ‚Äúdual use‚Äù loopholes to arm Putin. Was this standing up for liberal values or was it the pursuit of naked self-interest at the expense of democratic allies?

 As I drive down the eastern flank of this great nation, this is the question that keeps nagging at me. Poland has no natural defences (the Carpathian mountains are to the south), so its 700-mile eastern border is hopelessly exposed. This is a nation that was carved up by Habsburgs, Prussia and the Russian empire, obliterated from the map for 123 years, before being oppressed by the Bolsheviks. How, in this context, could the West have ignored this fledgling democracy‚Äôs cries for help? How could we have failed to grasp its anxiety that Nato membership might prove worthless in the event of a Russian invasion? This is a nation that has been betrayed before.

And isn‚Äôt it shameful that only now are the big western powers scrambling to act upon Poland‚Äôs advice? It‚Äôs a point made by Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at Sussex University. Germany has increased defence spending and suspended Nord Stream 2; Britain has confronted its addiction to dirty Russian money; even America is hinting at providing what Poland always wanted: a proper Nato base rather than a tripwire presence with little real capability.

 It was the poet Robbie Burns who said we need to ‚Äúsee ourselves as others see us‚Äù. And this, I‚Äôd suggest, is the most conspicuous lesson for western powers. Poland was not a backslider but a bellwether, shifting to the right out of existential fear as much as incipient racism. As a nation that hasn‚Äôt been successfully invaded since 1066, we sometimes find it hard to grasp how fears are passed from parents to children, encoded in stories of suffering and infusing a nation‚Äôs psyche.

I abhor the xenophobia and judicial interference of the Law and Justice Party (as do many Poles) and hope it is rejected at the next election. But I also understand why it invested in defence and cybersecurity even as Poland‚Äôs eastern neighbour was left exposed. As Szczerbiak put it: ‚ÄúIt is impossible to grasp the politics of Poland unless you first take the time to understand its history. The West has consistently failed to do that.‚Äù

I travel to the Medyka border crossing 40 miles north and notice a grand piano by the side of the road ‚Äî an incongruous sight. David is a concert pianist who has driven from Germany to provide solace for the refugees. His playing is dazzling as he starts with Billy Joel‚Äôs *Piano Man* and moves on to the Beatles.

 As refugees in their hundreds walk past, I am struck once again by their quiet courage. The women smile and the children offer fist bumps. I notice one girl shivering in a maroon scarf and hooded coat; she is holding a grey teddy almost identical to the most beloved toy of my daughter Evie. I reach down to stroke the girl‚Äôs hair and notice my cheeks are wet with tears.

As David continues to play, I find myself drifting into a reverie. What, I wonder, will future historians make of a mystifying era when conflict returned to Europe, fears of nuclear war were reignited and an unlikely hero called Volodymyr addressed the world‚Äôs legislatures via Zoom while eluding assassination attempts?

At least one thing is clear: Putin has singlehandedly achieved what the West failed to bring about in 30 years: unity of purpose. The West stands, more or less, united ‚Äî even if it is only Ukrainians who are shedding blood to keep Russia at bay. Finland and Sweden are contemplating joining Nato. Switzerland has abandoned neutrality. Sanctions bite ever more deeply (although they should go further). Even the Russian people ‚Äî at least those not brainwashed by Kremlin propaganda ‚Äî are leaving in droves, perhaps the greatest brain drain this century.

 In the long view of history, this battle will be seen as part of a wider confrontation between liberal democracy and the forces of authoritarianism. Even now, Taiwan is bracing itself against the expansionism of President Xi, who has not yet condemned the war in Ukraine. The Chinese politburo is as anxious as Putin to undermine the West, fearful that if the reputation of democracy rises again, their mercenary grip on power will weaken.

These are the stakes we face, aware that unless we hang together, we will hang separately. The third verse of Arthur O‚ÄôShaughnessy‚Äôs poem *Ode* ends: ‚ÄòFor each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth‚Äô. In the new age that started on February 24, it is vital that none of us in the West take our way of life for granted again.",poland,2022-03-20 14:19:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/tim2gh/long_read_in_bighearted_poland_they_hate_only_one/,"LONG READ: In big-hearted Poland they hate only one man: the new Hitler Matthew Syed - The Times

Dear People of Poland,"I am a Ukrainian with Polish roots, my grand grand parents were ""resettled"" to today's western Ukraine by soviets when they invaded Poland in 1939 along with nazis. I am very thankful to you guys for all your enourmous efforts in helping Ukraine, you are our main allies in this war, when we are surrounded by enemies on all sides except western. However, there is something that needs to be brought to attention. Among the refugees coming from Ukraine there is able-bodied men fit to hold a rifle that are abandoning their country when it needs them the most. Let it be known that it is a violation of Ukrainian laws. All men, fit for service, aged 18-60 are currently prohibited to leave Ukraine. Guess what? We all have families! This is no excuse! People who are currently fighting in the hottest spots in the east of Ukraine till their last drop of blood also all have families. Now more than ever they need our support, they need the Nation of Ukraine to unite and come to their aid. 

I urge you, if you see any Ukrainian men who have fled/are fleeing Ukraine into Poland, question them, shame them, call out to their manhood, their pride, their dignity. There is young girls serving in Armed Forces of Ukraine who are fighting and dying for their country right now, they are more men than these ""men"".

Right now it is extremely easy to join Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine for any Ukrainian. They will be armed and will have an opportunity to contribute to saving their country and saving lives of their fellow countrymen. 

Also, if you see any Ukrainian men who are already going FROM Poland TO Ukraine, please offer any help you can.

I am very thankful to you guys for all your enourmous efforts in helping Ukraine, you are our main allies in this war, when we are surrounded by enemies on all sides except western. However, there is something that needs to be brought to attention. Among the refugees coming from Ukraine there is able-bodied men fit to hold a rifle that are abandoning their country when it needs them the most. Let it be known that it is a violation of Ukrainian laws. All men, fit for service, aged 18-60 are currently prohibited to leave Ukraine. Guess what? We all have families! This is no excuse! People who are currently fighting in the hottest spots in the east of Ukraine till their last drop of blood also all have families. Now more than ever they need our support, they need the Nation of Ukraine to unite and come to their aid. 

I urge you, if you see any Ukrainian men who have fled/are fleeing Ukraine into Poland, question them, shame them, call out to their manhood, their pride, their dignity. There is young girls serving in Armed Forces of Ukraine who are fighting and dying for their country right now, they are more men than these ""men"".

Right now it is extremely easy to join Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine for any Ukrainian. They will be armed and will have an opportunity to contribute to saving their country and saving lives of their fellow countrymen. 

Also, if you see any Ukrainian men who are already going FROM Poland TO Ukraine, please offer any help you can. Keep in mind, we are fighting an enemy who is far more technologicaly advanced in terms of military equipment. Everything that can help will help. Optics, NVGs, Thermal Vision, Supressors, everything that can help us fight off the invaders. You CAN make a difference.

Greeting From Korean Report Writer!,"I am novel writer living in South Korea. But I decide to write a book about why Ukrainian fight, who they are, what they think. Because Ukrainian is Real Hero. They are more brave than Hero-In-Fiction. it's story have to be remembered.

FurtherMore, most korean don't know who is Ukraine, where is them, why they fight. But Ukraine's war is not unrelated war in other continent. Putin and Xi Jingping of CCP are tied by military alliance, If we,Korean, don't support Urainian, next war happen in Asia.

So I should refute Putin's lies about Ukraine in South korea to writer the truth. it's not only my  job, but also auty as citizen of free world. (Western ally saved Republic of Korea from Japan Empire and CCP's aggression in WW2 and Korean War. God Blees them.)

Unfortunately, I couldn't go Ukraine Itself because of governement traveling Ban. So, instead of Ukraine Itself, I will visit refugee camp in Poland and Romania. But I am not enough resource to do complete my goal.

I am english-Intermediate speaker, can't understad Ukrainian. My cash is only 5000 USD except Flight fee. The most hard stuff is that I had never been Poland, SO don't know where I should go.

Is it okay to have double standards on refugees?,"As we know, there is a significant difference in the reception of Ukrainian refugees and refugees from non European countries. There are two common explanations for this:

1. Proximity: Legitimate refugees flee the the nearest countries.
2. Cultural Compatibility: Countries should take strife who are of similar cultural to avoid strife.

But I see serious problems in such explanations. The first deals with proximity. There are many Ukrainians attempting to enter the United States, which is a country on a far away continent that requires massive amounts of travel. Would it be morally acceptable to deny these Ukrainians access after they have spend all their savings trying to reach the US because they are not legitimate refugees? Or is okay to agree with the fact that there is nothing wrong with refugees wanting to choose their own destination that they perceive to provide them the best possible future?

The second deals with cultural compatibility. If there was a sudden rise in refugees from socially conservative and mostly Catholic women and children fleeing genocide from Islamic radical terrorist groups, should they be allowed refugee status in Poland **IF** they also were of Sub Saharan African origin? Such groups would not be a good fit for more liberal countries like Germany/Sweden but a much better fit for Poland. They would go the the same church congregations as most poles and have fairly similar values. 

If you respond, it would be appreciated if you let me know if you are a Polish national and what your political spectrum is in relation to Polish politics. I am simply trying to understand and learn more about the main reasons for this discrepancy of treatment.",poland,2022-03-23 09:33:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/tkq53g/is_it_okay_to_have_double_standards_on_refugees/,"Is it okay to have double standards on refugees?

Would it be morally acceptable to deny these Ukrainians access after they have spend all their savings trying to reach the US because they are not legitimate refugees? Or is okay to agree with the fact that there is nothing wrong with refugees wanting to choose their own destination that they perceive to provide them the best possible future?

The second deals with cultural compatibility. If there was a sudden rise in refugees from socially conservative and mostly Catholic women and children fleeing genocide from Islamic radical terrorist groups, should they be allowed refugee status in Poland **IF** they also were of Sub Saharan African origin? Such groups would not be a good fit for more liberal countries like Germany/Sweden but a much better fit for Poland. They would go the the same church congregations as most poles and have fairly similar values. 

If you respond, it would be appreciated if you let me know if you are a Polish national and what your political spectrum is in relation to Polish politics. I am simply trying to understand and learn more about the main reasons for this discrepancy of treatment.",positive

Question about german refugees from WW2,"Hello everyone, I wanted to ask a quick question cause I was quite surprised recently about something that happened to my granny. To give some context: my granny was born in Breslau and at the age of 10 had to flee from the soviet army during ww2. She came to the west of germany so after the seperation of germany and during the cold war she was never able to visit Breslau again. In the 90s she decided to go to visit her moms grave. When she was there she went to see if the house she used to grow up in is still standing and to her surprise it was. She decided to ring the door bell and as she is able to speak some polish she explained to the owners why she was there and asked if she can look around a little bit. The owners of the house were very friendly and invited her to a drink in the garden. She is now 88 years old and wanted to go one last time, she went to the grave and decided to pay the house another visit. The owners of the house have changed so she explained again why she was there. The new owners didnt want her to be there (its understandable, I also wouldnt want a stranger in my garden) however they still talked a little bit and from the understanding of my granny the new house owners were suspecting her of claiming the ownership of the house back.

So my question is: Does that happen or did you guys ever hear about a case in which german refugees came to poland to claim their former property back and if yes, is that something uncommon? Being a german I've never heard of it and its really hard to imagine that this is a thing. I mean in the 90s I could see that happening just because that was the very first oppotunity for a lot of people but now after so much time I would be very surprised.",poland,2022-08-03 11:13:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/wf3ubu/question_about_german_refugees_from_ww2/,"Question about german refugees from WW2 Hello everyone, I wanted to ask a quick question cause I was quite surprised recently about something that happened to my granny.

And what kind of Doctors should i ask to join ? As they are leaving their patients in their city, they need to be efficient. So i thought about doing a first round for a medical check-up, with some generalists doctors and some specialists, and come back for a second round with more appropriate help resulting on the medical check-up.

Ukrainian refugees struggling to settle in Poland,"Using a throwaway as don't want to be identified on my main account. 

First of all, I want to thank all the Polish people for their hospitality and being so kind to my family. 

A few members of my family managed to leave Ukraine via Slovakia, another few members (close relatives of the first, think elderly mother / father) crossed the border at Poland. We are trying to work a way to settle the whole family together in Poland via the EU 3-year scheme announced a few weeks ago. This is where we faced our first hurdle. In all the advice we received from the information centres, they state that the family who crossed at Slovakia need to go back and won't be eligible to use the EU 3-year scheme in Poland.

This is very distressing for us as obviously, the family want to live together and not torn apart. When we mentioned the family members who crossed at Poland, the advice we got was that those members are welcome to stay but can't sponsor the remaining family members. Basically, their ties don't count towards giving priority for the other members to stay. 

It was not made clear to us when crossing the border that they would have to settle in the first country of entry. This also doesn't make sense to us as there are refugees who are moving multiple countries and going to countries which don't border Ukraine, are they also expected to go back?  

If anyone can provide any further advice or who we can speak to, we would be so grateful, as this situation has been very stressful on top of an already difficult situation.

TL;DR - Polish information centres say family members who crossed at Slovakia need to go back to claim the EU 3-year scheme for Ukrainians.

EU job board for Ukraine refugees,"Hi everyone,

 I am conscious the main necessities of Ukrainian refugees are now food, shelter and social care! I think these people will further need to integrate in our community, as it looks like the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country is continuously and significantly increasing.

Major success against foreign political influence !,"After concerns about foreign political influence were recently expressed from numerous individuals and institutions in Europe, today marks a major blow against such dubious schemes.

While cutting funding for projects such as Moroccan pottery classes, a DEI musical in Ireland or a transgender comic book in Peru, a host of Polish organizations also found themselves cut off from US tax dollars.

After concerns about foreign political influence were recently expressed from numerous individuals and institutions in Europe, today marks a major blow against such dubious schemes.

While cutting funding for projects such as Moroccan pottery classes, a DEI musical in Ireland or a transgender comic book in Peru, a host of Polish organizations also found themselves cut off from US tax dollars.

Przysz≈Ço≈õƒá relacji polsko-ukrai≈Ñskich,"Cze≈õƒá wszystkim. Zdecydowa≈Çem siƒô napisaƒá, poniewa≈º ostatnio czujƒô siƒô trochƒô zdesperowany z powodu wszystkich napiƒôƒá miƒôdzy Ukrai≈Ñcami a Polakami.

Nie jestem dobry w pisaniu po polsku, ale dobrze go rozumiem i mam nadziejƒô, ≈ºe nie ma tu zbyt wielu b≈Çƒôd√≥w, poniewa≈º du≈ºo pomogli mi Google Translator i GPT.

Od 24.02.2022 moja rodzina i ja mieszkamy w Polsce. Uciekli≈õmy przed wojnƒÖ pierwszego dnia i z jakiego≈õ powodu mnie wypu≈õcili, mo≈ºe dlatego, ≈ºe wszystko by≈Ço takie chaotyczne. Wiem, ≈ºe wielu ludzi po prostu nazwie to tch√≥rzostwem i powie, ≈ºe powinienem wr√≥ciƒá i walczyƒá, ale po prostu nie mogƒô. Jestem zbyt przestraszony, ≈ºeby to zrobiƒá. Bƒôdzie mnie to prze≈õladowaƒá przez resztƒô ≈ºycia.

Kocham Polskƒô, poniewa≈º naprawdƒô sta≈Ça siƒô drugim domem dla mojej rodziny. Moja ≈ºona i ja mamy ma≈Çe dziecko i nie mogƒô wam powiedzieƒá, ile mia≈Çem koszmar√≥w, i nadal mam, kiedy s≈Çyszƒô, co dzieje siƒô z dzieƒámi na Ukrainie. Ostatnia historia o kobiecie, kt√≥ra zosta≈Ça spalona ≈ºywcem z dzieckiem na rƒôkach w Charkowie z powodu ataku rosyjskiej rakiety, to co≈õ, czego ostatnio nie mogƒô wyrzuciƒá z g≈Çowy.

Przede wszystkim chcƒô podziƒôkowaƒá Polsce jako krajowi i Polakom jako narodowi za pomoc, kt√≥ra by≈Ça i jest nadal udzielana Ukrainie. To naprawdƒô du≈ºo. Mieli≈õmy i nadal mamy wiele r√≥≈ºnic w naszej historii i obecnych relacjach, ale wszyscy zrobili≈õcie tak wiele. Nie da siƒô opisaƒá, jak wiele to znaczy i ile ≈ºyci√≥w dotknƒô≈Ça ta pomoc.

Po drugie, chcƒô powiedzieƒá, ≈ºe jestem wdziƒôczny za bezpiecze≈Ñstwo mojej rodziny. Nie potrafiƒô opisaƒá uczucia, kiedy po prostu wiesz, ≈ºe teraz istnieje to nowe, zawsze czyhajƒÖce zagro≈ºenie dla twojego ≈ºycia. By≈Çem ""szczƒô≈õliwy"", ≈ºe poczu≈Çem to tylko przez chwilƒô, ale nadal pamiƒôtam to tak, jakby to by≈Ço dzisiaj. Wielu moich przyjaci√≥≈Ç prze≈ºywa to ka≈ºdego dnia. Teraz wiƒôkszo≈õƒá z nich po prostu m√≥wi, ≈ºe wszystko jest w porzƒÖdku... ale od czasu do czasu co≈õ w nich pƒôka i po prostu za≈ÇamujƒÖ siƒô na kilka dni. To ciƒÖg≈Ça presja, kt√≥rej nie da siƒô opisaƒá, i chocia≈º wstydzƒô siƒô to przyznaƒá, tak, jestem wdziƒôczny za nasze bezpiecze≈Ñstwo, kiedy tak wielu ludzi nie jest bezpiecznych.

Po trzecie, jestem wdziƒôczny za pomoc zwyk≈Çych Polak√≥w, kt√≥rzy w pierwszych dniach wojny pomogli tak wielu ludziom w desperacji. Czasami zastanawiam siƒô, czy my pomogliby≈õmy a≈º tak bardzo? Po prostu nie wiem. Byli≈õmy ""szczƒô≈õliwymi"" uchod≈∫cami; moja ciocia pracowa≈Ça w Polsce i mieli≈õmy miejsce na kilka dni, co pomog≈Ço nam znale≈∫ƒá miejsce do wynajƒôcia. Nasi gospodarze pozwolili nam mieszkaƒá za darmo przez 1 miesiƒÖc, chocia≈º nie przyszli≈õmy z pustymi kieszeniami; po prostu nie wziƒôli za ten pierwszy miesiƒÖc pieniƒôdzy.

Po czwarte, jestem wdziƒôczny za mo≈ºliwo≈õƒá legalnej pracy. Pracujƒô na umowie B2B z ameryka≈ÑskƒÖ firmƒÖ, wiƒôc to nie tak, ≈ºe Polska da≈Ça mi pracƒô, ale da≈Ça mi prawo do legalnej pracy, aby utrzymaƒá mojƒÖ rodzinƒô, i jestem za to wdziƒôczny.

MajƒÖc to wszystko na uwadze, ostatnie 6-8 miesiƒôcy by≈Ço naprawdƒô trudne dla relacji miƒôdzy UkrainƒÖ a PolskƒÖ, jak r√≥wnie≈º miƒôdzy Polakami a Ukrai≈Ñcami. Znam powody. Rozumiem waszƒÖ frustracjƒô zwiƒÖzanƒÖ z lud≈∫mi, kt√≥rzy nie sƒÖ wdziƒôczni. Rozumiem, ≈ºe ukrai≈Ñska polityka mo≈ºe byƒá problematyczna przez wiƒôkszo≈õƒá czasu. Wiem, ≈ºe ≈∫le siƒô czujecie z powodu waszych rolnik√≥w. Ale... dlaczego teraz wszystko jest TAK ≈∫le? W ostatnich miesiƒÖcach czujƒô, ≈ºe nie mo≈ºemy zrobiƒá nic dobrego... za ka≈ºdym razem, gdy wchodzƒô do Internetu, widzƒô mn√≥stwo komentarzy o tym, jak jeste≈õmy niewdziƒôczni, jak jeste≈õmy okropni, jak nasz kraj jest skorumpowany (czego nie mogƒô zaprzeczyƒá, to wstyd), ≈ºe nie mo≈ºna z nami rozsƒÖdnie rozmawiaƒá itd. Wiem, ≈ºe jest ogromna ilo≈õƒá trolli, a media zawsze interesujƒÖ siƒô z≈Çymi wiadomo≈õciami, ale na pewno wp≈Çynƒô≈Ço to na wielu rzeczywistych ludzi.

Istnieje kilka g≈Ç√≥wnych temat√≥w, kt√≥re sƒÖ czƒôsto poruszane w kontek≈õcie zmƒôczenia UkrainƒÖ i Ukrai≈Ñcami, takie jak:

Zbo≈ºeG≈Çupota naszego rzƒÖduZabezpieczenie spo≈ÇeczneNiegrzeczno≈õƒá ludziJe≈õli spojrzysz na tƒô listƒô pobie≈ºnie, nie wyglƒÖda to ≈∫le, prawda? Ale te tematy sƒÖ bardzo skomplikowane. ≈öledzƒô je wszystkie i kr√≥tko je om√≥wiƒô.Zbo≈ºe: C√≥≈º, Ukraina sprzedaje je w UE, poniewa≈º jest to dozwolone przez przepisy UE. Czy to ≈∫le dla Polski? Na pewno tak siƒô wydaje. Nie widzia≈Çem ≈ºadnych danych, kt√≥re pokazywa≈Çyby, ≈ºe gospodarka Polski naprawdƒô cierpi z powodu ukrai≈Ñskiego rolnictwa, ale rozumiem obawy. Nasze produkty sƒÖ po prostu ta≈Ñsze, poniewa≈º nie podlegajƒÖ tym samym przepisom. Czy to sprawiedliwe? C√≥≈º, nie sƒÖdzƒô, i wydaje siƒô, ≈ºe lepiej by≈Çoby, aby te zasady by≈Çy bardziej rygorystyczne, aby zapewniƒá, ≈ºe zbo≈ºe jest tylko tranzytowane lub kupowane w ≈õcis≈Çych limitach. Mimo to, dla mnie to dziwna sytuacja, poniewa≈º ludzie sugerujƒÖ, ≈ºe to 99% Ukraina jest w tej sytuacji w b≈Çƒôdzie. Proszƒô zrozumieƒá, ludzie zawsze bƒôdƒÖ wspieraƒá swoich rolnik√≥w. Ale pos≈Çuchajcie, Ukraina nie mo≈ºe sobie pozwoliƒá, aby nie sprzedawaƒá wszystkiego, co mo≈ºe; ka≈ºda z≈Çot√≥wka siƒô liczy. Ludzie m√≥wiƒÖ, ≈ºe ukrai≈Ñscy rolnicy w og√≥le nie sƒÖ rolnikami, tylko oligarchami, i czƒô≈õciowo jest to prawda. Niekt√≥rzy z nich to oligarchowie, niekt√≥rzy to koncerny UE, a prawie 50% z nich to klasyczni rolnicy. Ale bez wzglƒôdu na to, kto jest w≈Ça≈õcicielem ziemi, to rolnicy pracujƒÖ na tej ziemi. Prawie ca≈Çe obwody Zaporo≈ºa i Cherso≈Ñ sƒÖ okupowane, pomimo powszechnej opinii, ≈ºe po≈Çudnie jest bardzo przemys≈Çowe; poza miastami jest SUPER rolnicze. Dodajcie 50-100 km od frontu, aby zrozumieƒá, jak bezpiecznie jest byƒá rolnikiem na Ukrainie; to nie przepisy zabijajƒÖ nasze rolnictwo, to wojna. Ukraina nadal wype≈Çnia swoje kontrakty z AfrykƒÖ, pomimo utraty terytorium, i sprzedaje czƒô≈õƒá produkt√≥w w UE. Czy mo≈ºe byƒá ich za du≈ºo? Absolutnie. Czy Ukraina mo≈ºe sobie pozwoliƒá na niesprzeda≈º, je≈õli w og√≥le jest kupowana? W ≈ºadnym wypadku. Nikt nie prosi nikogo, aby zapomnia≈Ç o interesach swoich rodak√≥w; by≈Çaby to hipokryzja, ale jest czƒô≈õƒá tej sytuacji, kt√≥ra nie jest wystarczajƒÖco podkre≈õlona. Ukraina teraz kupuje od Polski kilka razy wiƒôcej produkt√≥w rolnych ni≈º przed wojnƒÖ, tworzƒÖc wiele nowych miejsc pracy w portach. Mo≈ºemy znale≈∫ƒá wsp√≥lny jƒôzyk; mo≈ºecie zaostrzyƒá przepisy, to wasze prawo, ale nie mo≈ºecie prosiƒá Ukrainy, aby kontrolowa≈Ça kupujƒÖcych na terytorium UE; nie mo≈ºemy sobie pozwoliƒá na niesprzeda≈º w og√≥le.

G≈Çupota naszego rzƒÖdu. Nie mogƒô broniƒá dzia≈Ça≈Ñ naszego rzƒÖdu, poniewa≈º by≈Çy liczne przypadki, kt√≥re zawstydzi≈Çyby mnie, nawet gdyby m√≥j wujek napisa≈Ç je anonimowo w internecie. Naprawdƒô mi przykro.

Zabezpieczenie spo≈Çeczne to kolejny istotny temat. Przede wszystkim ka≈ºda pomoc jest bezcenna i przepraszam, je≈õli sƒÖ Ukrai≈Ñcy, kt√≥rzy nie okazali wdziƒôczno≈õci za tƒô pomoc. Udzielono znacznej pomocy, ale g≈Ç√≥wne media i media spo≈Çeczno≈õciowe rozpowszechni≈Çy poglƒÖd, ≈ºe Ukrai≈Ñcy to po prostu pijawki ≈ºyjƒÖce z zasi≈Çk√≥w socjalnych. Wsparcie na dzieci, w szczeg√≥lno≈õci, by≈Ço i jest ratunkiem dla samotnych matek, kt√≥re nie mog≈Çy od razu pracowaƒá po ucieczce. Chocia≈º czƒô≈õƒá tego wsparcia by≈Ça finansowana z pieniƒôdzy UE, wiƒôksza czƒô≈õƒá pochodzi≈Ça z polskich podatk√≥w, co stanowi pomoc, kt√≥rej nie wszyscy mogli chcieƒá udzieliƒá, ale mimo to udzielili. Ostatnie raporty z ostatnich dw√≥ch lat pokazujƒÖ, ≈ºe prawie wszyscy uchod≈∫cy w wieku produkcyjnym sƒÖ zatrudnieni. Je≈õli wykluczymy dzieci, osoby starsze i niepe≈Çnosprawne z ca≈Çkowitej liczby, 67% wska≈∫nik zatrudnienia w≈õr√≥d pozosta≈Çych uchod≈∫c√≥w pokazuje, ≈ºe nie pr√≥bujemy nikogo wykorzystywaƒá. Co wiƒôcej, w zesz≈Çym tygodniu w polskim parlamencie jeden z ministr√≥w przedstawi≈Ç statystyki pokazujƒÖce, ≈ºe w≈õr√≥d wszystkich kraj√≥w przyjmujƒÖcych uchod≈∫c√≥w Polska ma najwy≈ºszy odsetek zatrudnionych w≈õr√≥d nich. W odniesieniu do innych program√≥w, takich jak darmowe zakwaterowanie czy poczƒÖtkowe 120 dni wsparcia 40+, zrozumia≈Çe jest, ≈ºe takie inicjatywy nie mogƒÖ byƒá utrzymywane w niesko≈Ñczono≈õƒá i nie sƒÖ dostƒôpne wszƒôdzie. IstniejƒÖ dyskusje na temat mo≈ºliwo≈õci wycofania dodatkowego wsparcia finansowego dla pracujƒÖcych uchod≈∫c√≥w, kt√≥rzy nie sƒÖ obywatelami Polski i nie majƒÖ czasowego lub stalego pobytu. By≈Çby to znaczƒÖcy krok wstecz, poniewa≈º te ≈õrodki, choƒá niewystarczajƒÖce do ≈ºycia, stanowiƒÖ znaczƒÖcƒÖ pomoc dla tych, kt√≥rzy sami opiekujƒÖ siƒô swoimi dzieƒámi. Te programy powinny rzeczywi≈õcie zostaƒá zrewidowane, aby zapobiec nadu≈ºyciom, ale poglƒÖd, ≈ºe wszyscy Ukrai≈Ñcy to pijawki, jest nieuzasadniony. To inna sytuacja dla tych, kt√≥rzy uciekli przed wojnƒÖ; nie wybrali migracji z przyczyn ekonomicznych, ale zostali zmuszeni do opuszczenia swojego ≈ºycia w jednej chwili. Jest dobrze znane, ≈ºe nie mo≈ºna prze≈ºyƒá tylko z zasi≈Çk√≥w na dzieci, a te sƒÖ wyp≈Çacane tylko na dzieci. Chocia≈º nie jest to czƒôsto dyskutowane, istniejƒÖ artyku≈Çy podkre≈õlajƒÖce, jak bardzo ukrai≈Ñscy uchod≈∫cy pracujƒÖ i przyczyniajƒÖ siƒô do podatk√≥w. Chcemy byƒá czƒô≈õciƒÖ spo≈Çeczno≈õci, ale pytanie o niemo≈ºno≈õƒá uzyskania karty pobytu w niekt√≥rych miejscach przez 2-3 lata oraz niemo≈ºliwo≈õƒá zarejestrowania swoich dzieci lub os√≥b, kt√≥re nie mogƒÖ pracowaƒá do swojej kartu pobytu, aby mog≈Çy legalnie tu przebywaƒá, jest bolesnƒÖ kwestiƒÖ.

Je≈õli chodzi o niegrzeczno≈õƒá, jest to rzeczywi≈õcie znaczƒÖcy problem. Niekt√≥rzy z naszych ludzi przyjƒôli mentalno≈õƒá, w kt√≥rej bycie asertywnym i nieustƒôpliwym jest jedynym sposobem, aby byƒá s≈Çyszanym, mentalno≈õƒá g≈Çƒôboko zakorzenionƒÖ jeszcze z czas√≥w sowieckich. Zmiana takich zachowa≈Ñ jest dla niekt√≥rych trudniejsza ni≈º dla innych, ale niegrzeczno≈õƒá nie jest wy≈ÇƒÖczna dla Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w; istnieje we wszystkich spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwach. Niegrzeczni ludzie wyr√≥≈ºniajƒÖ siƒô, poniewa≈º ich dzia≈Çania majƒÖ wiƒôkszy wp≈Çyw ni≈º dzia≈Çania uprzejmych ludzi, pozostawiajƒÖc trwa≈Çe wra≈ºenie. Spotka≈Çem niegrzecznych Polak√≥w, kt√≥rzy byli lekcewa≈ºƒÖcy wobec Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w, ale nie sƒÖdzƒô, aby reprezentowali ca≈ÇƒÖ populacjƒô. Podobnie, negatywne komentarze, kt√≥re widzia≈Çem, nie odzwierciedlajƒÖ postaw wszystkich Polak√≥w wobec Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w.

PodsumowujƒÖc, ten post nie ma na celu zmieniƒá czyjego≈õ zdania, byƒá obra≈∫liwym ani nikogo obra≈ºaƒá. Po prostu chcƒô zrozumieƒá wasze my≈õli i uczucia. Czy mo≈ºemy wsp√≥≈Çistnieƒá i znale≈∫ƒá kompromisy, czy sƒÖdzicie, ≈ºe sytuacja tylko siƒô pogorszy?

Prawie ca≈Çe obwody Zaporo≈ºa i Cherso≈Ñ sƒÖ okupowane, pomimo powszechnej opinii, ≈ºe po≈Çudnie jest bardzo przemys≈Çowe; poza miastami jest SUPER rolnicze. Dodajcie 50-100 km od frontu, aby zrozumieƒá, jak bezpiecznie jest byƒá rolnikiem na Ukrainie; to nie przepisy zabijajƒÖ nasze rolnictwo, to wojna. Ukraina nadal wype≈Çnia swoje kontrakty z AfrykƒÖ, pomimo utraty terytorium, i sprzedaje czƒô≈õƒá produkt√≥w w UE. Czy mo≈ºe byƒá ich za du≈ºo? Absolutnie. Czy Ukraina mo≈ºe sobie pozwoliƒá na niesprzeda≈º, je≈õli w og√≥le jest kupowana? W ≈ºadnym wypadku. Nikt nie prosi nikogo, aby zapomnia≈Ç o interesach swoich rodak√≥w; by≈Çaby to hipokryzja, ale jest czƒô≈õƒá tej sytuacji, kt√≥ra nie jest wystarczajƒÖco podkre≈õlona. Ukraina teraz kupuje od Polski kilka razy wiƒôcej produkt√≥w rolnych ni≈º przed wojnƒÖ, tworzƒÖc wiele nowych miejsc pracy w portach. Mo≈ºemy znale≈∫ƒá wsp√≥lny jƒôzyk; mo≈ºecie zaostrzyƒá przepisy, to wasze prawo, ale nie mo≈ºecie prosiƒá Ukrainy, aby kontrolowa≈Ça kupujƒÖcych na terytorium UE; nie mo≈ºemy sobie pozwoliƒá na niesprzeda≈º w og√≥le.

G≈Çupota naszego rzƒÖdu. Nie mogƒô broniƒá dzia≈Ça≈Ñ naszego rzƒÖdu, poniewa≈º by≈Çy liczne przypadki, kt√≥re zawstydzi≈Çyby mnie, nawet gdyby m√≥j wujek napisa≈Ç je anonimowo w internecie. Naprawdƒô mi przykro.

Zabezpieczenie spo≈Çeczne to kolejny istotny temat. Przede wszystkim ka≈ºda pomoc jest bezcenna i przepraszam, je≈õli sƒÖ Ukrai≈Ñcy, kt√≥rzy nie okazali wdziƒôczno≈õci za tƒô pomoc. Udzielono znacznej pomocy, ale g≈Ç√≥wne media i media spo≈Çeczno≈õciowe rozpowszechni≈Çy poglƒÖd, ≈ºe Ukrai≈Ñcy to po prostu pijawki ≈ºyjƒÖce z zasi≈Çk√≥w socjalnych. Wsparcie na dzieci, w szczeg√≥lno≈õci, by≈Ço i jest ratunkiem dla samotnych matek, kt√≥re nie mog≈Çy od razu pracowaƒá po ucieczce. Chocia≈º czƒô≈õƒá tego wsparcia by≈Ça finansowana z pieniƒôdzy UE, wiƒôksza czƒô≈õƒá pochodzi≈Ça z polskich podatk√≥w, co stanowi pomoc, kt√≥rej nie wszyscy mogli chcieƒá udzieliƒá, ale mimo to udzielili. Ostatnie raporty z ostatnich dw√≥ch lat pokazujƒÖ, ≈ºe prawie wszyscy uchod≈∫cy w wieku produkcyjnym sƒÖ zatrudnieni. Je≈õli wykluczymy dzieci, osoby starsze i niepe≈Çnosprawne z ca≈Çkowitej liczby, 67% wska≈∫nik zatrudnienia w≈õr√≥d pozosta≈Çych uchod≈∫c√≥w pokazuje, ≈ºe nie pr√≥bujemy nikogo wykorzystywaƒá. Co wiƒôcej, w zesz≈Çym tygodniu w polskim parlamencie jeden z ministr√≥w przedstawi≈Ç statystyki pokazujƒÖce, ≈ºe w≈õr√≥d wszystkich kraj√≥w przyjmujƒÖcych uchod≈∫c√≥w Polska ma najwy≈ºszy odsetek zatrudnionych w≈õr√≥d nich. W odniesieniu do innych program√≥w, takich jak darmowe zakwaterowanie czy poczƒÖtkowe 120 dni wsparcia 40+, zrozumia≈Çe jest, ≈ºe takie inicjatywy nie mogƒÖ byƒá utrzymywane w niesko≈Ñczono≈õƒá i nie sƒÖ dostƒôpne wszƒôdzie. IstniejƒÖ dyskusje na temat mo≈ºliwo≈õci wycofania dodatkowego wsparcia finansowego dla pracujƒÖcych uchod≈∫c√≥w, kt√≥rzy nie sƒÖ obywatelami Polski i nie majƒÖ czasowego lub stalego pobytu. By≈Çby to znaczƒÖcy krok wstecz, poniewa≈º te ≈õrodki, choƒá niewystarczajƒÖce do ≈ºycia, stanowiƒÖ znaczƒÖcƒÖ pomoc dla tych, kt√≥rzy sami opiekujƒÖ siƒô swoimi dzieƒámi. Te programy powinny rzeczywi≈õcie zostaƒá zrewidowane, aby zapobiec nadu≈ºyciom, ale poglƒÖd, ≈ºe wszyscy Ukrai≈Ñcy to pijawki, jest nieuzasadniony. To inna sytuacja dla tych, kt√≥rzy uciekli przed wojnƒÖ; nie wybrali migracji z przyczyn ekonomicznych, ale zostali zmuszeni do opuszczenia swojego ≈ºycia w jednej chwili. Jest dobrze znane, ≈ºe nie mo≈ºna prze≈ºyƒá tylko z zasi≈Çk√≥w na dzieci, a te sƒÖ wyp≈Çacane tylko na dzieci. Chocia≈º nie jest to czƒôsto dyskutowane, istniejƒÖ artyku≈Çy podkre≈õlajƒÖce, jak bardzo ukrai≈Ñscy uchod≈∫cy pracujƒÖ i przyczyniajƒÖ siƒô do podatk√≥w. Chcemy byƒá czƒô≈õciƒÖ spo≈Çeczno≈õci, ale pytanie o niemo≈ºno≈õƒá uzyskania karty pobytu w niekt√≥rych miejscach przez 2-3 lata oraz niemo≈ºliwo≈õƒá zarejestrowania swoich dzieci lub os√≥b, kt√≥re nie mogƒÖ pracowaƒá do swojej kartu pobytu, aby mog≈Çy legalnie tu przebywaƒá, jest bolesnƒÖ kwestiƒÖ.

Je≈õli chodzi o niegrzeczno≈õƒá, jest to rzeczywi≈õcie znaczƒÖcy problem. Niekt√≥rzy z naszych ludzi przyjƒôli mentalno≈õƒá, w kt√≥rej bycie asertywnym i nieustƒôpliwym jest jedynym sposobem, aby byƒá s≈Çyszanym, mentalno≈õƒá g≈Çƒôboko zakorzenionƒÖ jeszcze z czas√≥w sowieckich. Zmiana takich zachowa≈Ñ jest dla niekt√≥rych trudniejsza ni≈º dla innych, ale niegrzeczno≈õƒá nie jest wy≈ÇƒÖczna dla Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w; istnieje we wszystkich spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwach. Niegrzeczni ludzie wyr√≥≈ºniajƒÖ siƒô, poniewa≈º ich dzia≈Çania majƒÖ wiƒôkszy wp≈Çyw ni≈º dzia≈Çania uprzejmych ludzi, pozostawiajƒÖc trwa≈Çe wra≈ºenie. Spotka≈Çem niegrzecznych Polak√≥w, kt√≥rzy byli lekcewa≈ºƒÖcy wobec Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w, ale nie sƒÖdzƒô, aby reprezentowali ca≈ÇƒÖ populacjƒô. Podobnie, negatywne komentarze, kt√≥re widzia≈Çem, nie odzwierciedlajƒÖ postaw wszystkich Polak√≥w wobec Ukrai≈Ñc√≥w.

PodsumowujƒÖc, ten post nie ma na celu zmieniƒá czyjego≈õ zdania, byƒá obra≈∫liwym ani nikogo obra≈ºaƒá. Po prostu chcƒô zrozumieƒá wasze my≈õli i uczucia. Czy mo≈ºemy wsp√≥≈Çistnieƒá i znale≈∫ƒá kompromisy, czy sƒÖdzicie, ≈ºe sytuacja tylko siƒô pogorszy?
