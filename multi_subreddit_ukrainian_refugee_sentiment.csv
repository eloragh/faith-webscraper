Poland Belarus border crisis,"The Belarus Polish border crisis was planned in advance to this attack on Ukraine. To test division in the EU and check Polands border defenses. If Poland accepted a bunch of economic migrants from far away they would be weakened for the wave of true refugees coming from Ukraine right now. Putin is a psychopath and has manufactured this attack on Ukraine years in advance. Who knows what else he has planned to do.

Belarus might have even identified areas of weakness around the border in a reconnaissance mission under the guise of helping migrants.

Notice how it always happens in Winter because EU states are more scared to speak up as they are blackmailed by Russian gas. Looking at you Germany

The heartfelt and caring support towards not just to Ukranian refugees but also towards the many other world-wide nationals crossing the border into Poland is humanely beautiful. Allowing foreign students to take shelter and even carry on their studies within Poland is something I didn't even consider in this crisis, and I was brought to tears hearing the Polish representative. The general public opening their homes and offering their food to refugees is something I dearly hope is true.

LONG READ: In big-hearted Poland they hate only one man: the new Hitler,"Matthew Syed - The Times 

Across the expanse of the railway station I am drawn to him, sitting on a bench among dozens of other Ukrainian refugees. Perhaps it is something in his eyes, tired but defiant, or perhaps it is the sight of his younger brother weeping as his mother sleeps fitfully after a journey of indeterminate length. The boy beckons. “I can speak English a little,” he whispers. “My name is Oleksandr. Would you like to talk to me?”

I am in the Polish border town of Przemysl, and, to be frank, I am struggling to take it all in. It is a daunting privilege to witness the scenes of refugees huddling together in the cold, eyes haunted, bodies exhausted, fathers and husbands left behind to face pitiless bombing.

I am here to see the dynamics of this refugee crisis, but also the role of Poland. It is a nation that has been viewed as a backslider from western values, a nation that abhors immigrants, a country that symbolises the crisis in liberalism. The longer I stay here, though, the more I detect the myopia of this narrative, pushed by supposedly more enlightened EU partners like Germany and France.

But let me return to Oleksandr, a little Ukrainian boy with a huge heart. His arms are around his brother as he speaks, in faltering English, not about his own suffering but about the responsibility he feels for his mother and sibling — he is but 12 years old. “We travelled for three days and wondered if we would be killed by the airplanes,” he says. “But I didn’t want to leave [Ukraine](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/ukraine?page=1). I wanted to fight Putin with Papa.” His mother, roused from her slumber, hugs him tight, a grown-up before his time.

I move across the concourse of the neo-baroque station, beautiful paintings above, misery down below. I speak to Tatiana and her four children, whose home in the Donbas region was shaken by aerial bombardment and who huddled in a basement for two weeks, cold, frightened, hungry. I speak to Maria from Kharkiv, who journeyed for six days to escape Putin’s hell, with her six-year-old daughter Anna.

 When I ask how they coped, she shows me a picture her daughter has drawn. It is a large smiley face, an image they look at whenever they feel frightened about the fate of the husband and father left behind. “The picture makes us feel happy and safe,” she says quietly.

With each story, a new pixel emerges in the panorama of Putin’s unprovoked war, a new insight into its iniquity. In a narrow corridor I speak to Louisa, a grandmother whose memories reach back to the Second World War, sitting beside her daughter, Andzela, who is in a wheelchair after a stroke three years ago, and two grandchildren. She is a retired chef and talks proudly of her speciality of rice, meat, grated carrots and onions. You can see her strength, her warmth, her wide brown eyes projecting into my heart. “We didn’t want to leave our home,” she says. “We wanted to defy Putin. But we will not surrender; our men will keep going till the end.”

 And this mention of Putin hints at perhaps the most salient factor in this border town. Rich and poor, Polish and Ukrainian, relief workers and police officers, all are united in one visceral emotion. They hate the Russian leader. They do so with such feeling that many recoil when I mention his name. The hatred is not directed against the Russian people but against Putin himself: the man whose psychopathy led to this conflagration and the greatest European migration crisis since the Second World War.

“I am Russian by descent but I want to kill Putin,” says Anna, holding the hand of her daughter. “I feel guilty to use these words. But when you think of what he has done, the lies he tells his own people, the innocent people he is willing to kill, can you blame me? I have a friend who has died. My husband is still there. He calls himself president but he is the new Hitler.”

 The east of Poland is a landscape of rolling hills, scattered hamlets and smallholdings. I drive uphill to the border crossing at Kroscienko and note again the jarring contrast between the beautiful terrain and the tragedy contained in snaking lines of women and children heaving rucksacks and bags. From my vantage point above the holding centre I see a hive of activity as children eat soup served from large cylindrical containers warmed by naked flames, and their mothers ask for information about what bus will take them to their temporary homes.

From here, the idea that Poland is an unwelcoming nation seems more than a little jarring. It is true that it pushed back against the EU relocation scheme for Syrians fleeing conflict in 2015, hinting at a suspicion of multiculturalism and what many younger Poles tell me is a lingering bigotry against non-whites. But the arms thrown around two million Ukrainian refugees is nevertheless moving to behold, not least given the growing strain on public services, particularly around Warsaw.

 Anna, an engineer who repairs computers in Przemysl, has a family staying in her spare room and would happily take more. Lucian, in his twenties, has already offered to take another refugee, despite having three in his small flat. “You do what you can for these brave people,” he says.

At the holding centre in a former shopping arcade I see dozens more volunteers, many willing to drive refugees across Europe to reunite them with friends or family. I am reminded of the words of the Anglican preacher Henry Melvill. “A thousand fibres connect us with our fellow men; and among those fibres, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects.”

 And this is where I glimpse a different narrative from the one that has emanated from Berlin and Paris: a story of Poland not as a backslider from western values but a defender of them. For was Poland not right to call for more robust sanctions against Russia after the annexation of Crimea? Was it not wise to protest against German dependence on Russian gas? Was it not justified in shuddering as EU powers continued to send weaponry to a man who had levelled Grozny and Aleppo, even after the arms embargo of 2014?

On this last point, the Investigate Europe project has found that EU countries supplied Russia with €346 million of military equipment, including missiles, aircraft, rockets, torpedoes and bombs, between 2015 and 2020: weapons now being used to wreak devastation. Germany and France were the worst offenders, exploiting “dual use” loopholes to arm Putin. Was this standing up for liberal values or was it the pursuit of naked self-interest at the expense of democratic allies?

 As I drive down the eastern flank of this great nation, this is the question that keeps nagging at me. Poland has no natural defences (the Carpathian mountains are to the south), so its 700-mile eastern border is hopelessly exposed. This is a nation that was carved up by Habsburgs, Prussia and the Russian empire, obliterated from the map for 123 years, before being oppressed by the Bolsheviks. How, in this context, could the West have ignored this fledgling democracy’s cries for help? How could we have failed to grasp its anxiety that Nato membership might prove worthless in the event of a Russian invasion? This is a nation that has been betrayed before.

And isn’t it shameful that only now are the big western powers scrambling to act upon Poland’s advice? It’s a point made by Aleks Szczerbiak, professor of politics at Sussex University. Germany has increased defence spending and suspended Nord Stream 2; Britain has confronted its addiction to dirty Russian money; even America is hinting at providing what Poland always wanted: a proper Nato base rather than a tripwire presence with little real capability.

 It was the poet Robbie Burns who said we need to “see ourselves as others see us”. And this, I’d suggest, is the most conspicuous lesson for western powers. Poland was not a backslider but a bellwether, shifting to the right out of existential fear as much as incipient racism. As a nation that hasn’t been successfully invaded since 1066, we sometimes find it hard to grasp how fears are passed from parents to children, encoded in stories of suffering and infusing a nation’s psyche.

I abhor the xenophobia and judicial interference of the Law and Justice Party (as do many Poles) and hope it is rejected at the next election. But I also understand why it invested in defence and cybersecurity even as Poland’s eastern neighbour was left exposed. As Szczerbiak put it: “It is impossible to grasp the politics of Poland unless you first take the time to understand its history. The West has consistently failed to do that.”

I travel to the Medyka border crossing 40 miles north and notice a grand piano by the side of the road — an incongruous sight. David is a concert pianist who has driven from Germany to provide solace for the refugees. His playing is dazzling as he starts with Billy Joel’s *Piano Man* and moves on to the Beatles.

 As refugees in their hundreds walk past, I am struck once again by their quiet courage. The women smile and the children offer fist bumps. I notice one girl shivering in a maroon scarf and hooded coat; she is holding a grey teddy almost identical to the most beloved toy of my daughter Evie. I reach down to stroke the girl’s hair and notice my cheeks are wet with tears.

As David continues to play, I find myself drifting into a reverie. What, I wonder, will future historians make of a mystifying era when conflict returned to Europe, fears of nuclear war were reignited and an unlikely hero called Volodymyr addressed the world’s legislatures via Zoom while eluding assassination attempts?

At least one thing is clear: Putin has singlehandedly achieved what the West failed to bring about in 30 years: unity of purpose. The West stands, more or less, united — even if it is only Ukrainians who are shedding blood to keep Russia at bay. Finland and Sweden are contemplating joining Nato. Switzerland has abandoned neutrality. Sanctions bite ever more deeply (although they should go further). Even the Russian people — at least those not brainwashed by Kremlin propaganda — are leaving in droves, perhaps the greatest brain drain this century.

 In the long view of history, this battle will be seen as part of a wider confrontation between liberal democracy and the forces of authoritarianism. Even now, Taiwan is bracing itself against the expansionism of President Xi, who has not yet condemned the war in Ukraine. The Chinese politburo is as anxious as Putin to undermine the West, fearful that if the reputation of democracy rises again, their mercenary grip on power will weaken.

These are the stakes we face, aware that unless we hang together, we will hang separately. The third verse of Arthur O’Shaughnessy’s poem *Ode* ends: ‘For each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth’. In the new age that started on February 24, it is vital that none of us in the West take our way of life for granted again.",poland,2022-03-20 14:19:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/tim2gh/long_read_in_bighearted_poland_they_hate_only_one/,"LONG READ: In big-hearted Poland they hate only one man: the new Hitler Matthew Syed - The Times

Where are all the mentally ill people in Poland?,"I'm born/raised in Manhattan but I've been living in Poland for 5 years, between Lublin, Warsaw, and Kraków.

Walking trip from Western border of Poland to Warsaw,"Hello,

Next year, I would like to do a walking/backpacking trip from the western border of Poland to Warsaw, following rural roads or trails. My reason for this trip has to do with re-tracing some family history from World War II. The route would be from Kostrzyn nad Odrą to Warsaw, about 460 km.

My question - is this a reasonable/safe trip for me to try and do?

I live in Alaska, and I am an experienced international travel, hiker, and navigator. I have done ""long walks"" like this many time before. They are usually in remote off-road areas though, and I am camping every night. I have not yet ever visited Europe. I do not speak Polish or German, but am learning. I would prefer to camp on this trip too, but can afford to stay in hotels/hostels if need be.

Do you think I will have trouble finding places to camp? If anyone has useful perspective or thoughts for a walking trip through rural Poland, or what the locals might think, I would be eager to hear it.

USA to Poland immigrant,"Cześć everyone! I have a weird situation, and I could use some clarity about immigrating to Poland from the USA. (I know I would get more from the Polish language version of this sub, but I do not speak the language that well yet.) Throwaway because I don't want this level of detail attached to my main account.

My mom was taken to the US after having been born and completing first grade in Poland. She was separated from her family by CPS, and is now the only person from her family in the USA besides myself. As an adult she applied to ~~reinstate~~ (EDIT: confirm) her Polish citizenship and it was granted.

Enter me; the only person in my entire family born in the USA and the only one in the family with English as my first language. My mom, who was traumatized from her separation, never taught me Polish as she wanted me to ""fit in"" to the US. I can speak some now, but I would say an A1 level.

Now my family wants me to apply to become a dual citizen with Poland. It is difficult for us to communicate as none of my relatives speak any English besides my mom, so although they have offered to help with the paperwork I am not entirely clear on the details. I have some pathway to citizenship from being born to a Polish person, but am unsure if that comes with the language level requirement of B2 or not. I am 100% committed to learning Polish either way since I am the odd one out speaking English in my family.

We did not do well economically in the US because there was so little support for kids in the foster care system. However, my University degree is in a field which is still in demand (thank goodness) and I already work online remotely, making about $1,500 - 2,000 USD/month (part time), potentially more if I get a full time job (working on it). It is not enough to cover all of our living costs. There is also no family here for us to lean on or celebrate with, and as I am now in my mid 20's and see my friends move with family in mind, it is a bit isolating.

I understand the cost of living is rising in Poland, but with the tariffs, the bird flu, and general market instability my cost of living has already gone up exponentially here as well, especially in terms of groceries. I am also acclimated to cold/dark weather, having spent time living near the Canadian border. I am single. I feel no particular loyalty to the US.

Because of this, I told my mom and my family back in Poland I would be willing to move to Poland and try a new start there. I have a TEFL and am not above boosting my income through housecleaning/childcare/teaching and have done so already. They live near a major city. I have been to Poland to visit, and I loved it there, but they gave me a very curated/tourist experience visiting the sites and museums and stuff, so I saw less of the day-to-day.

That being said: does anyone have any advice for me? If I live in Poland for a year and speak at a B2 level, am I then a full Polish citizen after filing the paperwork (I have all the requested documents)? My mom was able to keep her US passport so I'm assuming I won't have to give mine up either? How concerned should I be about the war coming to Poland? I know Polish is difficult to learn (trust me, I'm trying!), but are there any other cultural issues I will have moving from the States? Anything I need to consider besides work/legal stuff (social life, politics, etc.)? I understand the sentiment everywhere is not that keen on immigrants at the moment, but I fully look Polish so I am not sure I will face the same scrutiny as the immigrants I'm reading about. I am planning to fully assimilate back into Poland and live there/ in the EU as a Polish citizen permanently. How realistic/delusional is that plan?

Dziękuję for reading!

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this much interest in my post! Thank you all. I will get through all the comments eventually, but I have to get back to work now.

A couple of things are coming up a lot, including misconceptions about America that I initially got from my Polish family too! I have never in my life had a brand-new phone, I have never owned a car, I have never been able to afford to live on my own, and I have never had a TV. When I say we did not grow up well economically I mean I was cleaning houses when I was 16 and we lived in a trailer with a plywood floor and creek water for dishes. All of my savings were lost to one unfortunate hospital visit. I am fine with the basics, and I only shop secondhand. I will bring my current laptop and phone with me, which I have had for 5 years now! :)

My goals for moving would be to 1) reconnect with family/heritage, and 2) live somewhere I can afford to survive (I do not live in the midwest here, and trust me, everywhere I looked In Poland is much more affordable than my current situation!) and get basic medical care that will not bankrupt me. I understand I might need to work for an international company or otherwise bring in money that is not Zloty to afford something like buying a place of my own one day, but that is absolutely beyond my reach here. I am in the red every month, as is my mom. Also, I am a woman and honestly, things are a little tense for women where I am right now. Definitely not safe for me to walk around alone after sunset haha, and medical care is limited.

I am more liberal than the Democratic party in the US. I am anti-gun and pro-union. I did not initially mention it because, although the climate is very concerning here right now, that was not a motivation for this move.

I have an in-demand degree in the HR/Communications/It industry. I also have a TEFL. I also have a Masters degree related to Tech! I saw some comments about that, so hopefully this helps. I don't want to be too specific as I probably shared too much about my life on the internet with this post already haha. My absolute life dream would be to get a PhD and become a professor in Computer Science or English, but that is a long way off. I do have some teaching experience at every level.

I have a weird situation, and I could use some clarity about immigrating to Poland from the USA. (I know I would get more from the Polish language version of this sub, but I do not speak the language that well yet.) Throwaway because I don't want this level of detail attached to my main account.

My mom was taken to the US after having been born and completing first grade in Poland. She was separated from her family by CPS, and is now the only person from her family in the USA besides myself. As an adult she applied to ~~reinstate~~ (EDIT: confirm) her Polish citizenship and it was granted.

Enter me; the only person in my entire family born in the USA and the only one in the family with English as my first language. My mom, who was traumatized from her separation, never taught me Polish as she wanted me to ""fit in"" to the US. I can speak some now, but I would say an A1 level.

Now my family wants me to apply to become a dual citizen with Poland. It is difficult for us to communicate as none of my relatives speak any English besides my mom, so although they have offered to help with the paperwork I am not entirely clear on the details. I have some pathway to citizenship from being born to a Polish person, but am unsure if that comes with the language level requirement of B2 or not. I am 100% committed to learning Polish either way since I am the odd one out speaking English in my family.

We did not do well economically in the US because there was so little support for kids in the foster care system. However, my University degree is in a field which is still in demand (thank goodness) and I already work online remotely, making about $1,500 - 2,000 USD/month (part time), potentially more if I get a full time job (working on it). It is not enough to cover all of our living costs. There is also no family here for us to lean on or celebrate with, and as I am now in my mid 20's and see my friends move with family in mind, it is a bit isolating.

I understand the cost of living is rising in Poland, but with the tariffs, the bird flu, and general market instability my cost of living has already gone up exponentially here as well, especially in terms of groceries. I am also acclimated to cold/dark weather, having spent time living near the Canadian border. I am single. I feel no particular loyalty to the US.

Because of this, I told my mom and my family back in Poland I would be willing to move to Poland and try a new start there. I have a TEFL and am not above boosting my income through housecleaning/childcare/teaching and have done so already. They live near a major city. I have been to Poland to visit, and I loved it there, but they gave me a very curated/tourist experience visiting the sites and museums and stuff, so I saw less of the day-to-day.

That being said: does anyone have any advice for me? If I live in Poland for a year and speak at a B2 level, am I then a full Polish citizen after filing the paperwork (I have all the requested documents)? My mom was able to keep her US passport so I'm assuming I won't have to give mine up either? How concerned should I be about the war coming to Poland? I know Polish is difficult to learn (trust me, I'm trying!), but are there any other cultural issues I will have moving from the States? Anything I need to consider besides work/legal stuff (social life, politics, etc.)? I understand the sentiment everywhere is not that keen on immigrants at the moment, but I fully look Polish so I am not sure I will face the same scrutiny as the immigrants I'm reading about. I am planning to fully assimilate back into Poland and live there/ in the EU as a Polish citizen permanently. How realistic/delusional is that plan?

Dziękuję for reading!

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this much interest in my post! Thank you all. I will get through all the comments eventually, but I have to get back to work now.

A couple of things are coming up a lot, including misconceptions about America that I initially got from my Polish family too! I have never in my life had a brand-new phone, I have never owned a car, I have never been able to afford to live on my own, and I have never had a TV. When I say we did not grow up well economically I mean I was cleaning houses when I was 16 and we lived in a trailer with a plywood floor and creek water for dishes. All of my savings were lost to one unfortunate hospital visit. I am fine with the basics, and I only shop secondhand. I will bring my current laptop and phone with me, which I have had for 5 years now! :)

My goals for moving would be to 1) reconnect with family/heritage, and 2) live somewhere I can afford to survive (I do not live in the midwest here, and trust me, everywhere I looked In Poland is much more affordable than my current situation!) and get basic medical care that will not bankrupt me. I understand I might need to work for an international company or otherwise bring in money that is not Zloty to afford something like buying a place of my own one day, but that is absolutely beyond my reach here. I am in the red every month, as is my mom. Also, I am a woman and honestly, things are a little tense for women where I am right now. Definitely not safe for me to walk around alone after sunset haha, and medical care is limited.

I am more liberal than the Democratic party in the US. I am anti-gun and pro-union. I did not initially mention it because, although the climate is very concerning here right now, that was not a motivation for this move.

I have an in-demand degree in the HR/Communications/It industry. I also have a TEFL. I also have a Masters degree related to Tech! I saw some comments about that, so hopefully this helps. I don't want to be too specific as I probably shared too much about my life on the internet with this post already haha.

Why do polish people drive so dangerously?,"Hi guys,

Ever since I started driving I’ve noticed one thing on czech highways, polish drivers drive so dangerously all the time. 

They drive as if there was no tomorrow and as if they didn’t care about their life or others’ safety. (I’m not even talking about polish truck drivers…). This observation is probably supported by higher number of car accidents per capita in Poland.

Poland’s Donald Tusk declares war on beavers ,"https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-donald-tusk-declare-war-beaver-flood/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=social

As Poland struggles under the weight of deadly flooding caused by heavy rains across Central Europe, the Polish prime minister blamed beavers for exacerbating the problems.

At a recent crisis team meeting Tusk raised the issue of dam and dike safety — which, he said, is being threatened by the furry animals.

Beavers create their own dams to make a comfortable home for their families while protecting themselves from predators — but, according to some researchers, with whom Tusk seems to agree, those dams can damage riverbanks, weaken levees through burrowing and cause a buildup of water.

“Sometimes you have to choose between love for animals and the safety of cities, villages and the stability of dikes,” Tusk said, adding that infrastructure must be defended from beavers and that the government will allow any action, within the law, against beavers to safeguard levees.",poland,2024-09-25 07:16:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/1foym80/polands_donald_tusk_declares_war_on_beavers/,"Poland’s Donald Tusk declares war on beavers  https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-donald-tusk-declare-war-beaver-flood/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_medium=social

Polish perception of travelers coming in to Poland with regard to Ukraine humanitarian crisis,"\*\*Note: This is not about the military situation in Ukraine - it's about the refugees coming in to Poland + the support Poland has been offering

&#x200B;

Hi all, I'm thinking about traveling to Poland for holiday for a few days in April. However, I was unsure whether now was a ""good time"" for travelers to travel to Poland. What I mean by that is that, given that many AirBnBs/hotels/Polish people in general have been supporting Ukrainian refugees, are external travelers coming in to Poland still welcome? Or would we be seen as an unnecessary burden on a society busy with doing more productive things (ie: helping Ukrainian refugees)?

&#x200B;

The last thing I want to do is cause unnecessary annoyance or troubles for Poland, and so wanted to gauge the general atmosphere before confirming these travels.

Three years in Poland,"This is a post in which I will try to describe the last three years of my life with a bit of background. If you have any questions regarding moving to Poland, obtaining citizenship, enrolling in a university, finding a job, or even learning the language – feel free to ask. I will respond.

I had been planning to move to Poland for a long time, a very long time, and the process itself took about nine years. I started learning Polish in my second year of university in 2013, and in early 2014, I visited Poland for the second time and studied for a month at a summer language school. Then, in 2017, I obtained a Pole's Card. I wanted to leave but reconsidered, deciding that I needed to learn the language better.

In July 2018, I was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. In January 2019, I enrolled in Polish language courses at the Polish embassy. In August 2019, I participated in the summer Polish language school once again.

At the summer school, I met a girl who came to visit me for two weeks five months later. She became my guiding star, finally pushing me to move to Poland. In November 2019, I passed a Polish language proficiency exam at the B1 level (although I assessed my level as B2, but I decided not to take any risks).

I planned to move to Poland between August and October 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was unable to visit my girlfriend and meet her family in March. During the pandemic, due to work problems, I worked at a funeral agency, carrying coffins and burying the deceased, which taught me to take death more lightly.

It was funny – I tried more than five times to fly to Poland in August 2020, but new restrictions kept being introduced, flights were canceled, or borders were closed. In September 2021, I managed to fly to my girlfriend's country on a French visa and lived in her house for three months. Then we flew to my country so that I could finish my paperwork and settle remaining matters, spending two months there.

In February 2022, my final move to Poland took place. I had to take COVID-19 tests twice and get vaccinated multiple times, but it was manageable. In February, I rented an apartment, in March, I found a job, and in July, I enrolled in a university and decided to study Hungarian. I considered it an opportunity to change myself. Learning such a difficult language would allow me to test my cognitive abilities, which I do not rate highly.

In August, my girlfriend and I visited her family once again. I obtained a permanent residence permit. I had to visit various offices multiple times, confirm documents, and fill out forms, but people were polite.

At the end of September, at her initiative, we broke up. Shock, depression, antidepressants. In October, I started university, and in early November, I rented a new apartment. At the end of November, I attended a Hungarian studies scientific conference in Warsaw. I made new friends and started participating in a scientific circle. I spent my first birthday in Poland. I spent my first Christmas in Poland with a friend's family – a very interesting experience.

In March 2023, I started going to the gym and taking care of myself. I had my wisdom teeth removed. I passed my exams. In July 2023, I went to Hungary for a one-month volunteer program. It was a bit difficult – I assess my English proficiency as near zero. I simply never learned it – perhaps as some kind of internal protest against the established system. But I communicated in Hungarian, and I had good practice.

In August 2023, I found a new job on a part-time basis to combine with university studies. I applied for citizenship. In the fall, I attended a Hungarian studies conference for the second time, celebrated my birthday, Christmas, and other holidays in Poland.

In March 2024, I received confirmation of my Polish citizenship. Amusingly, it did not bring me much joy. I received my Polish identity card. In April, I applied to change my name and surname to Polonize them. In June, I received confirmation of the name change. In July, I obtained a new identity card with updated data. I applied for a place in a student dormitory.

In August, I went to a summer Hungarian language school in Budapest – I have a hobby of going to summer schools on scholarships for a month. In October, I moved into a dormitory and got a private room, resembling a small apartment, for a modest price.

In January 2025, I applied for funding to obtain a driver's license. February 2025 – now I am preparing to move to Budapest for a student exchange program. For now, I plan to live and study in Hungary for one and a half years, but I hope I can stay there for three years.

Over these three years in Poland, my Polish proficiency has reached the C2 level, largely thanks to studying and working. On the plus side, I stopped eating sweets, started checking product labels for sugar content, and quit alcohol. I received high-quality medical care in Poland – modern therapy for asthma, which significantly improved my life: I was able to start running, continue working out in the gym, and even climb mountains. I learned how to navigate the Polish healthcare system and handle paperwork.

Overall, Poland has proven to be a safe country for me. In three years of living here, I have not fallen victim to any crimes. What I dislike most is that shops, except for Żabka (a monopoly), do not operate on Sundays – but that is a minor issue. I like Polish family values and traditions.

Now, my plans include learning Hungarian at the C1 level, starting to learn English, at least mastering 850 words of basic English and its simple grammar, and overcoming my laziness. A friend who is a programmer sent me many programming courses, and after moving on a scholarship, I will start learning programming. We’ll see what comes of it. Perhaps I will be able to save up for a car to travel between Poland and Hungary or elsewhere in the EU.",poland,2025-02-04 13:23:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/1ihhjle/three_years_in_poland/,"Three years in Poland This is a post in which I will try to describe the last three years of my life with a bit of background.

In March 2024, I received confirmation of my Polish citizenship. Amusingly, it did not bring me much joy. I received my Polish identity card. In April, I applied to change my name and surname to Polonize them. In June, I received confirmation of the name change. In July, I obtained a new identity card with updated data. I applied for a place in a student dormitory.

In August, I went to a summer Hungarian language school in Budapest – I have a hobby of going to summer schools on scholarships for a month. In October, I moved into a dormitory and got a private room, resembling a small apartment, for a modest price.

In January 2025, I applied for funding to obtain a driver's license. February 2025 – now I am preparing to move to Budapest for a student exchange program. For now, I plan to live and study in Hungary for one and a half years, but I hope I can stay there for three years.

Over these three years in Poland, my Polish proficiency has reached the C2 level, largely thanks to studying and working. On the plus side, I stopped eating sweets, started checking product labels for sugar content, and quit alcohol. I received high-quality medical care in Poland – modern therapy for asthma, which significantly improved my life: I was able to start running, continue working out in the gym, and even climb mountains. I learned how to navigate the Polish healthcare system and handle paperwork.

Overall, Poland has proven to be a safe country for me. In three years of living here, I have not fallen victim to any crimes. What I dislike most is that shops, except for Żabka (a monopoly), do not operate on Sundays – but that is a minor issue. I like Polish family values and traditions.

Now, my plans include learning Hungarian at the C1 level, starting to learn English, at least mastering 850 words of basic English and its simple grammar, and overcoming my laziness. A friend who is a programmer sent me many programming courses, and after moving on a scholarship, I will start learning programming. We’ll see what comes of it. Perhaps I will be able to save up for a car to travel between Poland and Hungary or elsewhere in the EU.",positive

What would you vote in the upcoming immigration referendum?,"Yesterday the prime minister announced a referendum to be held in October regarding the EU system of relocation for illegal migrants coming from the Mediterranean Sea and the Turkish border.

The system should, roughly, relocate those people on every EU country with some quotas determined on their economic capabilities and population.

What do you think? Should poland accept this system and take the (illegal) migrants from the middle East and Sub saharian Africa or not?

Crying boy on medyka border (to poland),"A few days ago several news websites reported about ukrainian refugees crossing the polish border (medyka border). They also showed a young boy crying. They didn't show any person taking care of him and it appeared to me as if this boy was there alone.

I contacted the medyka border people but they didn't reply yet. Can anyone confirm that this boy has someone that takes care of him? I'd pick him up personally and offer whatever needed, but I don't know even how to get any info. I cant find sleep at night out of fear that this boy might be on his own with no one really taking care of him.

I blurred his face but if you have seen / know him one should still be able to recognize who he is.

This is btw not the 11yo with the phone number on his hand!

Observations from a tourist perspective,"Context: I'm an exchange student from Asia to Europe and was here for a short trip before I return home. Only been to Krakow and Warsaw for 7 days in total, but the place and the people here (poland and r/poland) had made such a strong impression and I just wanna hear what are your opinions on my observations. 

Infrastructure:
1. As per most European countries, tap water is portable which is always appreciated. Seems like there is a strong pride in clean water here, iirc there was a post on r/warsaw asking how to deliver water and got flamed so bad. 
2. Public transport is rather efficient but so difficult to understand for foreigners??? Took me a few days to figure out the transport system/ticke in krakow and I was leaving by the time I figured it out. Bus and trams are on time most of the time, which is definitely good enough for a tourist but not sure how it is for people who have to get to work on time.
3. Cityscape is amazing with the mix of former communist buildings, religious buildings and modern architecture.
4. Drainage for snow/water is unexpected bad considering how much snow is here every year! But maybe its just me being stupid trying to drag my luggage around :/

Food:
1. As an Asian who had been in Europe for the last few months, food here has oddly reminded me of home. Pierogi (both soft and fried) is so similar to Asian dumplings (Please don't fight on which is better). Also soup with noodles which is available at most polish restaurants taste exactly like food at home, maybe a little saltier, but still amazing. It's also interesting because there are dishes like schnitzel which are similar to the German counterparts. And then there are the soups, which are just mind blowingly good. Not an ad but I ate at Szalone Widelce in krakow and it was pretty unforgettable. Overall, the food here seems like an amazing fusion of European and Asian food to me.

Culture:
1. As I booked my train tickets on pkp website, I was under the impression that only Polish was spoken here (English translation was horrible). So I was ready to face a similar situation as France. But it was surprising to see the number of languages spoken here. Truly unexpected English fluency considering only 37% of the population here speaks English (according to a Google search, please correct me on this). Also there were strangers who tried to speak to me in Chinese, Cantonese and Korean, beyond just the usual greetings. 
2. As observed on many posts in r/polish, there is a general lack of smiles here which may seem cold at first. Many Google reviews on restaurants and cafes also include comments about the lack of smiles on service staff. But personally I thought its fine, at least they are not rude or anything and I get some stares but have yet to face any racism. In fact there are more people striking friendly conversations with me here and recommending places to go than any other European cities.

Others:
1. Safety. Honestly, everywhere feels so safe, whether it's on the streets or in public transport, which is rather unlike major european cities, like Paris, Lisbon, Rome, etc. News of the rocket on the border of Poland made me reconsider whether to come but I'm glad I still came. 
2. Cost of living. For how safe and good the cities and food are, the cost of living is really low. I'm surprised to see Google reviews of restaurants commenting that the food is expensive. Christmas markets are genuinely pricier and on par in terms of price with other European cities. 

Conclusion: Poland had been an amazing end to my exchange in Europe and I am truly impressed by the country. I hope to be able to come back again and explore the other cities :D

If I wrote anything offensive or incorrect, please correct me! Also, please let me know where else and what else I should see/try the next time I come back to Poland!

Thinking of moving from London to Gdansk - advice appreciated! :),"Hi everyone :) First time Reddit user here who would love some honest advice on the prospect of moving from London to Gdansk and thoughts on work-life balance and quality of life. Will give some backstory on why I'm thinking about this - apologies may be a little long but I'd appreciate your thoughts as I'm deep in philosophical crisis mode!

I'm a 32 yo woman and fully Polish but was born and raised in London. English is my native language but I do understand a lot of Polish, and can speak fairly broken Polish - lower intermediate I'd say. Growing up I tried to distance myself from my Polish heritage so I could belong to my peer group more, and because the English culture felt more progressive and open-minded, but that feeling has changed. I don't have much anchoring me in the UK anymore and I would love to feel more in touch with my heritage.

I've struggled to find lasting friendships of substance in the UK. I've always connected more with people from different cultures, and the English friendships I do have are quite surface level and my peers are preoccupied with drinking, taking drugs, and excessive social media use. And don't even get me started on the toxic dating landscape here! (Curious, are Polish men more respectful to women?) I've returned to Poland for a few holidays throughout my 20's and I see that things are changing there now - it's not as strict and stoic as it used to be, and my generation there seem to be a lot more genuine, cultured and interesting to talk to in comparison.

Other factors at play in the UK are the eye watering costs of renting, mainly in mouldy houses with greedy landlords, and it's impossible to get a one bedroom flat as a single person on the average wage here and increasing cost of living. Crime is worsening, as a woman I don't feel safe here, the government has continued to ruin this country, and public services don't set out to genuinely help people. Everyone is obsessed with working into the ground and I've been unemployed for a year because of how burnt out I got.

This time off has made me realise I really resent living here. Everyone says London is the land of opportunity and there's no better place to live - but I feel gaslit having this narrative fed to me when I see the reality. I want a better life for myself. I have tried living in other areas of the UK, which I have enjoyed, but many parts of the wider toxicity still remain.

I haven't actually visited Gdansk (I've been to Krakow, Warsaw, Katowice, Augustow), but in the research I'm doing I love the idea of living there because I don't want a huge city and I love living near water and greenery. My career has been in the non-profit sector working for charities, coordinating community projects and working with local residents - which I'd love to continue doing - but I do wonder what my prospects are as someone who isn't fully fluent in Polish yet (but wanting to learn!) and how easy or not easy it would be to gain employment here. I know full well that there would be huge pay reductions, and that doesn't bother me, so long as my money stretches further than it does here and I have a better work-life balance, and the people are nicer!

If you've made it through my long post - thank you for reading! Much appreciated.

"I'm on my knees before you, people","Hello from Ukraine!

&#x200B;

My family is not big. It's my wife and our child, my soon to be 11 months old little angel. I'm lucky enough that the company I work with provided us with option to relocate my family to Poland once russians attacked us. It took us lots of time to think it over, but a family night spent in cold basement due to air alarm convinced me that moving my wife and child to Poland is right thing to do at this time. 

&#x200B;

We were planning our future, we found proper development company with perfect conditions that settled us and were building a house. House where my daughter would grow up. Now there's great uncertainty ( at least for nearest future )

&#x200B;

Everyone is helping. She was met at the border by volunteer woman Katarzyna, who woke up early in the night because she is from Warsaw and drove to meeting point at the border and then drove my wife and child to safe point in Katowice. 

&#x200B;

Katowice holds special place in my heart. I used to play CSGO and visited Katowice 2 years in a row (last time we were there was 2020 when Spodek stadium was closed to public due to corona)

&#x200B;

I am on my knees crying and thanking you all for all the support my people and my wife with child received. Katarzyna refused any money I had to offer her. If you are reading this, I, for as long as I have to live, will never forget your help and your name.

My family is not big. It's my wife and our child, my soon to be 11 months old little angel. I'm lucky enough that the company I work with provided us with option to relocate my family to Poland once russians attacked us. It took us lots of time to think it over, but a family night spent in cold basement due to air alarm convinced me that moving my wife and child to Poland is right thing to do at this time. 

&#x200B;

We were planning our future, we found proper development company with perfect conditions that settled us and were building a house. House where my daughter would grow up. Now there's great uncertainty ( at least for nearest future )

&#x200B;

Everyone is helping. She was met at the border by volunteer woman Katarzyna, who woke up early in the night because she is from Warsaw and drove to meeting point at the border and then drove my wife and child to safe point in Katowice. 

&#x200B;

Katowice holds special place in my heart. I used to play CSGO and visited Katowice 2 years in a row (last time we were there was 2020 when Spodek stadium was closed to public due to corona)

&#x200B;

I am on my knees crying and thanking you all for all the support my people and my wife with child received. Katarzyna refused any money I had to offer her. If you are reading this, I, for as long as I have to live, will never forget your help and your name.

Depresion,"It's going to be long and sad. But I don't know who to turn to. Even the helpline disappointed me, only making the situation worse. But let's go step by step.

I'm in my forties, with 13 years of marriage. Two kids on board. My wife has always been pathologically jealous and insecure (difficult childhood). I lived with it and did everything I could to make her feel as good as possible (anyone in a marriage knows that it's not always rosy, even if we wish it were otherwise).

It started to go downhill when I started working in a mixed team (men and women) three years ago. The company is great, with integration trips, training, a good job with better pay and most importantly, opportunities for development. After years of hard work for a bowl of rice, I thought I had hit the jackpot.

I didn't go anywhere for an overnight stay during this whole period because she would make scenes. I ran across half of Poland just to see the company's results conference, and when everyone else went to have fun, I obediently and dutifully returned home. It hurt, but family comes first.

My wife went on sick leave a year ago for almost half a year (physical injury), after which she changed jobs to one where she is alone at her position almost all day. This greatly worsened her mental state, which wasn't great after the sick leave.

Now I'm at the end of my rope. My project at work is entering a decisive phase, we're going to present it at a trade fair, I have to go because I know the most about it, and she's threatening suicide... Since I told her about the trip, she's been lying down, crying, telling me how she's going to do it, when, that the dead are calling her. At night she wakes me up to convince me that it would be better for us without her (what the...).

I previously tried proposing a psychologist, couples therapy, but she won't go tell a stranger. I dragged her to a psychiatrist by force, but the appointment is on Monday and I won't be there, and one visit won't change anything.

I wrote that the helpline disappointed me: in desperation last week I wrote to the crisis helpline chat, asking where to look for immediate help and what to do at all. Two days later, the police and an ambulance showed up at her work, they went to her parents', her previous job, and finally found her at the new one. How it crushed her, I don't need to tell you. I don't know who else could have called them? No one knew except me. It had to be them. At least now the matter is public. I can't count on her parents, I got scolded that I should take care of the house because the police are bothering them because of me and other such things. My mother is sick and can't watch her in my absence. She tries to give advice at most because she's been fighting it herself for a long time. Previously, no one knew because I wasn't allowed to talk about her with anyone because of threats of suicide and other things. Yes, I let myself be pushed around, I know.

What am I considering? Either I quit my job today or I go on sick leave (but then I'll have to break something, too many times something happened at the last minute and I let them down), or... And this option scares me the most but also seems the best: I call 112 and beg them to take her to the hospital.

Does anyone have experience with such a ward? How do the emergency services respond to such matters? I'm afraid they'll come, take her blood pressure and tell her to go to the clinic. And then no one and nothing will protect and watch over her anymore.

Outrage in Poland as former national team player Maciej Rybus (66 apperances) makes interview to rationalize his stay in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine,"Maciej Rybus is a former Legia Warszawa player who later went to play in Russia. In years 2012-16 he played for Kadyrov's Terek Grozny and after that (and good EURO 2016) he went to Olympique Lyon. He couldn't make it there, so he came back to Russia. In years 2017-2022 he played for Lokomotiv Moscow. After Russian invasion of Ukraine he decided to stay in Russia (as opposed to Sebastian Szymański or Grzegorz Krychowiak for example). This was his end of career in Polish national team. Now he's a Rubin Kazan player.

Yesterday he made his first big interview since 2022 for a Polish TVP Sport. Here's a translation - I also **highlighted**his most controversial statements (in eyes of Polish public).  
Here's original: [https://sport.tvp.pl/76697312/maciej-rybus-pierwszy-taki-wywiad-zostajac-w-rosji-nie-zrobilem-nikomu-krzywdy](https://sport.tvp.pl/76697312/maciej-rybus-pierwszy-taki-wywiad-zostajac-w-rosji-nie-zrobilem-nikomu-krzywdy)

*Sebastian Staszewski, journalist (J): Do you still have a Polish passport?*  
Maciej Rybus (MR): That's one way to start an interview.

*J: To warm you up*

MR: Yes, I do. And why shouldn't I have one?

*J: Reading the comments appearing on the internet after you decided to stay in Russia after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, one appeared particularly often: 'Rybus, give up your Polish passport'.*

MR: I was getting all sorts of messages. They wrote that I had sold out, that they should draft me into the Russian army. That I should get the fuck out and not come back to Poland. That I was a rag, a traitor, a Russian onuca (footwrap associated in Poland with Russian army and sympathisers of this country).

*J: Did that hurt?*

MR: It did hurt. But by deciding to stay in Russia, I knew what might await me.

*J: Let us start from the beginning: On 24 February 2022, the troops of the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine and started a war that continues to this day. Despite the war, however, you decided to stay in Russia and play in the league there. Why?*

MR: It's all more complicated than people think.

*J: This is no explanation. Life is the art of choices.*

MR: At the beginning I didn't want to react rashly. What happened surprised everyone, including me, no one had any idea how the situation would develop, how long this war would last. I was wrestling with my thoughts, analysing. Should I stay? Or maybe leave? I didn't know what to do.

*J: Many athletes didn't have this dilemma. They simply packed their suitcases and left Russia after a few months. Like Sebastian Szymanski or Rafal Augustyniak. You stayed.*

MR: They had nothing in common with the country. They had contracts and that was all. I, on the other hand, have a wife there who is Russian, two sons, **real estates**, a life that has developed over ten years. **In fact, it was in Russia that I became a real man, started a family, made money and secured our future**. It was also where I achieved my greatest footballing successes. Leaving it all overnight was not so easy.

*J: And in retrospect, after two years of war, do you think it was a good choice?*

MR: For my family - for sure.

*J: And for you?*

MR: As a professional athlete, I faced harsh criticism many times, but what happened after the war broke out was like an avalanche that crushed me. At a certain point I couldn't cope, the scale of the heckling was unbelievable. It was thousands of posts, hundreds of private messages. Some of them were going over the top, writing, for example, that I should die. People around me advised me to give up social media, but I didn't want to be hounded. In the end I didn't do it, but for a few months I tried not to put anything on Twitter or Instagram, because any activity resulted in an outpouring of shit.

*J: Your decision stirred up huge emotions in Poland, sometimes - as you yourself noted - extreme. However, you could have expected this.*

MR: Interestingly, I only saw these emotions on the Internet. No one ever approached me on the streets. Neither in Russia, nor in Poland, nor anywhere else. Recently in Antalya, we ran into a group of Poles. The only thing I heard from them was a request to take a picture together. It was the same just after the outbreak of war, when I wanted to fly to the country. There were no more connections to Moscow, so someone suggested flying to Kaliningrad and then crossing the border on foot. I was travelling with my older son, people helped us a lot. The situation only changed online. There I immediately became a 'Russian'.

*J: You mention the family, its welfare. Isn't that a mere excuse?*

MR: It isn't.

*J: Or did you, however, act cynically and choose the money you could have earned in Russian clubs? The former deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Marcin Przydacz, once called them ""bloody"".*

MR: And what exactly did he say?

*J: I'll quote his entry from June 2022: ""There is nothing more embarrassing than hiding behind +family welfare+ when it is simply about big money. And it's blood money"".*

MR: This is the Minister's opinion. He was entitled to it. But actually, you can answer one question for me: why should I have left Russia?

*J: Everyone will find a different reason.*

MR: But I ask you: why do you think I should have left then?

*J: Because it is immoral to make Russian money in the middle of a war, when thousands of people, including children, are dying in Ukraine, when the world discovers massacres like the one in Bucha.*

MR: But am I doing anyone any harm?

*J: You don't have to run around the forest with a rifle and shoot to do harm.*

MR: After all, I am doing the same thing I did before the war.

*J: Circumstances have changed, however. Before there was no war, now there is.*

MR: **I understand**, anyone in my position would have had the right to make their decision. I made mine. Not under the pressure of people or posts on the Internet, but according to my conscience. I like life in Russia, in Moscow. I quickly acclimatised there, got to know the language, the people, who are my friends. The family feels comfortable there. **But, unfortunately, war broke out... Some time ago, when I was flying on holiday, the seat next to me was taken by Anatoly Tymoshchuk, a legend of the Ukrainian national team.** **After the war he stayed in St Petersburg. He is in a similar situation to me, he has a Russian wife, children who were born there. And he had similar dilemmas.** Someone will say that we made a lot of money, so we could move to Spain or Cyprus at any time. **We probably could, but it would be starting life all over again**. Nothing pleasant, especially for the children.

*J: Do they understand what is happening around Dad?*

MR: Probably not, the sons are too young. But Lana regularly received offensive posts. In Polish, Russian, English. She went through hell. But she's an Ossetian from Vladikavkaz, women there are very strong.

*J: Doesn't war raise the temperature in your home? You're a Pole, she is a Russian.*

MR: **No, we don't talk about it at all**. Even at the beginning it sometimes happened, because you know that for everyone what is happening in Ukraine was a shock, but **later we decided to avoid the subject. It may surprise someone, but we don't have Russian television in our flat. Neither do we have a Polish one. We have a TV, but we only watch Netflix, YouTube on it.**

*J: And you don't know what's going on in the world?*

MR: **I look at Twitter, but I try to avoid war topics.**

*J: It's a convenient explanation. You cover your eyes, plug your ears, and people are dying a few hundred kilometres away. And you say, ""I don't know, I'm busy.""*

MR: It's not like that. I'm experiencing it all very much. But I don't want to go crazy. I have a family to provide for, I have a job to do. Let me repeat: I am not hurting anyone by my actions.

*J: In that case, can you say outright that you condemn the war in Ukraine?*

MR: I believe that every war is evil, because every war brings death and many other terrible things. Like all reasonable people, I would prefer the world to be at peace. But, unfortunately, this is not always the case.

*J: In the summer of 2022, you had a good opportunity to change your surroundings. After five years of playing for Lokomotiv Moscow, your contract with that club came to an end. You had a card in your hand, you were the master of your fate, you could have chosen to play in another country. Why didn't you take that chance?*

MR: Because I only got one offer: from Spartak Moscow. I also had the option to extend my contract with Loko by one year, but Spartak offered a two-year contract. I had no other options. (This is a lie or he lied before. In an interview for Russian Bookmaker-Ratings a year ago he said he had a lot of offers, as [weszlo.com](https://weszlo.com/) noticed).

*J: It was only June, the beginning of the transfer window. If you had waited a few weeks, something would probably have come up.*

MR: Maybe yes, maybe no. **Spartak offered a contract for two seasons, for very good money**. **I like to have everything under control, especially in such uncertain times**. So I figured that at my age - and I was about to turn 33 - a better offer wouldn't come along.

*J: So money was the deciding factor.*

MR: Rather, it was the **stability they could guarantee us.**

*J: It never crossed your mind to leave Russia?*

MR: **Once. When Prigozhin's raid on Moscow was underway. Lana and the kids were in the capital, and I was in Kazan. We were all filled with fear.**

*J: You could move to Poland...*

MR: My dad, when he was still alive, strongly urged me to do so, especially in the first months after the war broke out. **We thought about it, but I don't know if Lana would be able to find her way in Poland.** She would be far away from her family and friends, **she wouldn't know the language**. **The same goes for our sons, who mainly speak Russian**. For them, it would be a complete novelty. I myself have not lived in Poland for a dozen or so years...

*J: So how does a Pole live in Russia?*

MR: The same as before the war.

*J: Do you not feel any hostility?*

MR: No one approaches Poles on the streets there, no fingers are pointed at us. On Christmas Eve, I went to a pastoral service in a Polish church in Moscow. It was the first time since I played in Russia. On 21 December my dad died and something inside told me to go... The service was in Polish, the majority in the church were Poles, although there were quite a few foreigners as well. So it is not that I am the only Pole in Russia. There are many. And they all function normally. I only had trouble once, before the match against Sweden. Robert Lewandowski called me. He asked if it was safe in Moscow, if we should play against the Russians. **Later the decision was made that we were boycotting the match. We were to post a graphic on Instagram declaring that we were refusing to play. I didn't think, I live in Russia, and I shared that too.** **Well, and the hejt poured in from the other side. Hundreds of messages. After fifteen minutes, I decided to delete the post.**

*J: Did you want to play with the Russians?*

MR: No, it wasn't about that. **I wanted peace of mind.**

*J: You talk about family, stability, peace of mind. Or should you admit outright that Russia is your place on earth? You went there more than ten years ago, to Grozny. Anyway, this episode of your career has also aged ugly. Today, Ramzan Kadyrov's brutal troops are fighting Ukrainians.*

MR: I didn't see this coming in 2012...

*J: This is unnecessary irony.*

MR: But what else am I supposed to answer to such a question? There were four of us at Terek: Piotrek Polczak, Marcin Komorowski, Maciek Makuszewski and me. We went to play football, not to play politics. In fact, for three of the four years we lived in Kislovodsk, a few hundred kilometres from Grozny. We only visited the city on the occasion of home matches. And it was very safe there. Sure, you could see the scars of war, damaged buildings or police patrols armed to the teeth, but in general - nothing was happening there.

*J: You did, however, meet Kadyrov. And you were in his villa.*

MR: Yes, once, with the whole team.

*J: You also got a Mercedes from him. As a birthday present when you scored two goals against Dynamo Moscow. Do you still have it today?*

MR: **Not from Kadyrov, but from Magomed Daudov, the president of Terek**. It was a gift I got not because of affection but because of my football achievements. I drove it for a year and a half and then sold it to the team manager. (Another lie he was caught on. During TV interview ""Po Gwizdku"" in 2021 he said: It was after the match against Dynamo Moscow, in which I scored two goals. Kadyrov called coach Cherchesov, who turned on the speakerphone. First I heard birthday wishes and then a promise that a present would be waiting for me when I returned to Grozny. And it was a new Mercedes).

*J: You left Chechnya after four years by moving to Lyon. However, you only lasted one season in France. And... you returned to Russia again.*

MR: At that time I could have stayed in Grozny, they offered me one million euros a year, the highest contract in Terek's history, because previously they paid a maximum of 600,000. But I refused, I wanted to try something else. Olympique was a great club, runner-up in France, they had great players like Memphis Depay, who I got on well with. I played a dozen games there, in the quarter-finals of the Europa League I scored a penalty in a series of eleven against Besiktas, in the semi-finals against Ajax Amsterdam I scored an assist. A fun adventure, but unfortunately the minutes spent on the pitch were lacking, and the World Cup in Russia, which I really wanted to go to, was approaching. So I decided to change my surroundings. A great offer came from Lokomotiv.

*J: And it was the shot of a lifetime?*

MR: Definitely. With Loko I won the championship, two cups, the super cup. I played thirteen games in the Champions League, against Bayern Munich, Juventus, Atletico Madrid. **I made a lot of money.** And I had an excellent time there, because it's a club that is far from a corporation like Spartak, for example. It's a place where I felt at home. To this day I still keep in touch with the club's staff. I am, by the way, a supporter - of Legia and Lokomotiv. **I will never regret this choice.**

*J: And the transfer to Spartak? As I mentioned before, it was a great opportunity to leave Russia. And in the end - apart from the money - you didn't gain much from the move.*

MR: Spartak is the most popular club in Russia, just like Legia in Poland has fans all over the country. Although, when I was there, there was a protest going on and attendance at the stadium was low. By contrast, when we went to other cities, Spartak supporters were in hotels, airports and shops. However, I only played a few games and although we finished third in the league, I actually cannot consider this transfer a success.

*J: In the end you ended up at Rubin Kazan, where you have not actually played since the beginning of the season.*

MR: I didn't have much choice. I only heard back from Rubin, there was also a vague enquiry from Baltika Kaliningrad. It started nicely in Kazan, because on the occasion of the match against Spartak the club representatives presented me with a bronze medal for the previous season. But in the league I played only once, a dozen minutes, just then. And to this day I am still healing the injury....

*J: If you heal it, are you still going to play in the Russian league?*

MR: We'll see. I'm not thinking that far ahead. Or maybe I won't return to playing again?

*J: Is it possible?*

MR: Everything is possible. I've been struggling with a knee injury, a muscle injury for a long time. During the winter I worked for almost two months in Turkey to get back to health, and so far everything is going in the right direction. I miss the joy of playing football, I miss the adrenaline. But some things I can't jump over. If I'm not able to play at a good level, then I'll say thank you.

*J: Then maybe you will finally leave Russia?*

MR: I haven't thought about that yet. **I used to plan to help Mariusz Piekarski as a liaison officer in the east after my career ended**. Poland's relations with Russia seemed to be correct, there was no feeling of hatred in either country. **So I thought I would live in Moscow, use my contacts, my knowledge of the language, and help organise transfers. But the war broke out**. I also planned to live for two countries, because there were up to five planes a day flying directly from Warsaw to Moscow. But the war broke out. And nothing came out of my plans again. That's why I'm not planning anything now.

*J: And if there is eventually an offer from a country other than Russia?*

MR: **I will go wherever they want me. It's not that I insisted on Russia.**

*J: You are unlikely to end your football career in Poland....*

MR: I doubt it. If I'm healthy, I think I could play another two, maybe three years. But Legia are unlikely to take me anymore.

*J: Then maybe Pelikan Łowicz, whose former junior you are?*

MR: I'd rather say no.

*J: You are unlikely to play for the Polish national team anymore either. Although as recently as March 2022 you were called up for the match against Sweden. This aroused a lot of emotion, by the way.*

MR: At that time Czesław Michniewicz called up me, Krychowiak and Szymański, who played for Dynamo. Krycha and I travelled to the national team via Kaliningrad, where we arrived by plane, and then we reached Poland by crossing the border in Bezledy. Unfortunately, the day after it turned out that I had a coronavirus and against Sweden I did not play. As it turned out - this was probably my last opportunity to play in the white-and-red jersey.

*J: How did you take Michniewicz's decision?*

MR: At first I was sad, no one would want to end with the national team in such a way. But I understood the coach. Anyway, Michniewicz called me earlier. I was just at my sister's place in Łowicz. He said he wouldn't call me up because the controversy surrounding the situation was very big, all the noise would interfere with preparations. Well, he was probably right.

*J: Did chairman of Polish FA Cezary Kulesza or Michniewicz persuade you to leave Russia and - by doing so - keep your chance to play for the national team?*

MR: This is my life and my career. Nobody is going to tell me what to do.

*J: I ask if there was pressure.*

MR: No, there was none. After all, as a Loko footballer, I received a call-up. On the other hand, I knew that it was just a matter of time that I would not be welcome on the national team. Anyway, I had some signals, my manager was also Michniewicz's agent, so leaks were reaching me.

*J: The Polish Football Association published an announcement on 20 June 2022. ""The coach informed the player that, due to his current club situation, he will not call him up for the September national team training camp and will not be taken into account when determining the composition of the team that will go to the World Cup."" In your opinion, was this a good decision by the Polish federation?*

MR: When Michniewicz called, I was not surprised. ""I said, 'Coach, I don't have any complaints'. I was already in my thirties, I wasn't playing regularly at the club, the youngsters were pushing and there was no certainty that I would go to the World Cup. I had come to terms with that. The only unpleasant thing was the thought that I would never play for the national team again.

*J: If you were sure you would go to the World Cup, would you have left Russia?*

MR: **I would certainly have considered it more seriously.**

*J: In total, you played 66 matches in the national team. Are you not expecting a farewell at the National Stadium?*

MR: No. Instead of applause, there would probably be a lot of whistling.

*J: Do you still keep in touch with your teammates?*

MR: Of course. With Kamil Glik, Kamil Grosicki, Szymański, Karol Świderski, Tomek Kędziora. I even wrote with him recently. I think each of them understands my situation.

*J: Why have you been silent for the last two years?*

MR: I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. I had dozens of interview offers from the Polish media, after matches in the mixed zons Russian journalists asked me about politics, passports. But I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to harm myself, my family. **These days one word can cause a storm. Anyway, Mario \[Piekarski\] saw for himself what a row there could be after such an interview**. Because of one, he had to delete his Twitter account. (I am not sure after which interview Piekarski deleted his account. Probably after the one where he compared Rybus's situation with a murder od Gdańsk mayor Paweł Adamowicz during charity event. Piekarski had some... controversial takes regarding Russia before).

*J: Are you no longer afraid now?*

MR: I've matured into it. I've thought some things through, I probably needed to understand. In retrospect, it's good that I didn't answer some questions in the heat of the moment. Life has many shades and sometimes it's hard to see. **I have nothing to reproach myself with**. **Over the years I have done my best to represent my country to the best of my ability and I think I didn't deserve the treatment I received after the war broke out**. But I know how it is, emotions run high, so I accept what happened.

*J: And aren't you worried that you will be remembered not for your 66 national team appearances, including the one against Germany when we won 2-0 in Warsaw, but precisely for the decision you made at the start of 2022?*

MR: I don't care about that.

*J: Everyone would like to be remembered well.*

MR: And how will you remember me?

*J: We have known each other for 15 years, we are friends. So I am not neutral. I was thinking more about the millions of fans.*

MR: I'm interested in how the people I care about will remember me. **And they will remember me as a solid footballer and a good person**. That's enough for me.

Summary:  
This interview became the hottest topic in Polish football yesterday and Rybus was widely criticized by journalists and fans (with small minority NameBunchOfNumbers defending him). Here are some of the opinions:

Jan Mazurek ([weszlo.com](https://weszlo.com/)): He doesn't give a shit about the war on Ukraine. He covers his ears and pretends not to hear, like Rudolf Höss and his wife Hedwig in the ""Zone of Interest"" at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Liar. A traitor. Putin's man. Shame that Maciej Rybus ever played for the Polish national team.

Damian Smyk ([Goal.pl](https://goal.pl/)): Maciej Rybus is a Soviet footballer and should be treated as such. I hope this interview is his last appearance in the Polish media. He should be forgot in the category of a Polish player. We don't write about some Vladimir Duporov of FK Mukhosransk, then we don't have to write about Rybus either.

Krzysztof Stanowski ([weszlo.com](https://weszlo.com/) and Kanał Zero owner, one of the most influential journalists recently): Rybus has no interest, no knowledge, no insight, avoids war topics. All he has on his TV is Netflix. But he was scared once: when Prigozhin was going to Moscow. That's when he got interested. Calm down, Maciek. Prigozhin is dead, Putin is holding firm. You can sleep peacefully.

Michał Kołodziejczyk (Canal+Sport director in Poland): Until Maciej Rybus gave interviews, I thought there was something I didn't know about his remaining in Russia. It turns out that you could judge without fear. It is enough to know that he is stupid but rich.

Cezary Kucharski (former NT player and former Lewandowski's agent): Maciek Rybus admittedly holds a Polish passport but has completely soaked in homosovieticus mentality. And he probably isn't even aware of it.",poland,2024-03-31 18:09:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/1bsgrbz/outrage_in_poland_as_former_national_team_player/,"Outrage in Poland as former national team player Maciej Rybus (66 apperances) makes interview to rationalize his stay in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine Maciej Rybus is a former Legia Warszawa player who later went to play in Russia. In years 2012-16 he played for Kadyrov's Terek Grozny and after that (and good EURO 2016) he went to Olympique Lyon. He couldn't make it there, so he came back to Russia. In years 2017-2022 he played for Lokomotiv Moscow. After Russian invasion of Ukraine he decided to stay in Russia (as opposed to Sebastian Szymański or Grzegorz Krychowiak for example). This was his end of career in Polish national team. Now he's a Rubin Kazan player.

Yesterday he made his first big interview since 2022 for a Polish TVP Sport. Here's a translation - I also **highlighted**his most controversial statements (in eyes of Polish public).  
Here's original: [https://sport.tvp.pl/76697312/maciej-rybus-pierwszy-taki-wywiad-zostajac-w-rosji-nie-zrobilem-nikomu-krzywdy](https://sport.tvp.pl/76697312/maciej-rybus-pierwszy-taki-wywiad-zostajac-w-rosji-nie-zrobilem-nikomu-krzywdy)

*Sebastian Staszewski, journalist (J): Do you still have a Polish passport?*  
Maciej Rybus (MR): That's one way to start an interview.

*J: To warm you up*

MR: Yes, I do. And why shouldn't I have one?

*J: Reading the comments appearing on the internet after you decided to stay in Russia after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, one appeared particularly often: 'Rybus, give up your Polish passport'.*

MR: I was getting all sorts of messages. They wrote that I had sold out, that they should draft me into the Russian army. That I should get the fuck out and not come back to Poland. That I was a rag, a traitor, a Russian onuca (footwrap associated in Poland with Russian army and sympathisers of this country).

*J: Did that hurt?*

MR: It did hurt. But by deciding to stay in Russia, I knew what might await me.

*J: Let us start from the beginning: On 24 February 2022, the troops of the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine and started a war that continues to this day. Despite the war, however, you decided to stay in Russia and play in the league there. Why?*

MR: It's all more complicated than people think.

*J: This is no explanation. Life is the art of choices.*

MR: At the beginning I didn't want to react rashly. What happened surprised everyone, including me, no one had any idea how the situation would develop, how long this war would last. I was wrestling with my thoughts, analysing. Should I stay? Or maybe leave? I didn't know what to do.

*J: Many athletes didn't have this dilemma. They simply packed their suitcases and left Russia after a few months. Like Sebastian Szymanski or Rafal Augustyniak. You stayed.*

MR: They had nothing in common with the country. They had contracts and that was all. I, on the other hand, have a wife there who is Russian, two sons, **real estates**, a life that has developed over ten years. **In fact, it was in Russia that I became a real man, started a family, made money and secured our future**. It was also where I achieved my greatest footballing successes. Leaving it all overnight was not so easy.

*J: And in retrospect, after two years of war, do you think it was a good choice?*

MR: For my family - for sure.

*J: And for you?*

MR: As a professional athlete, I faced harsh criticism many times, but what happened after the war broke out was like an avalanche that crushed me. At a certain point I couldn't cope, the scale of the heckling was unbelievable. It was thousands of posts, hundreds of private messages. Some of them were going over the top, writing, for example, that I should die. People around me advised me to give up social media, but I didn't want to be hounded. In the end I didn't do it, but for a few months I tried not to put anything on Twitter or Instagram, because any activity resulted in an outpouring of shit.

*J: Your decision stirred up huge emotions in Poland, sometimes - as you yourself noted - extreme. However, you could have expected this.*

MR: Interestingly, I only saw these emotions on the Internet. No one ever approached me on the streets. Neither in Russia, nor in Poland, nor anywhere else. Recently in Antalya, we ran into a group of Poles. The only thing I heard from them was a request to take a picture together. It was the same just after the outbreak of war, when I wanted to fly to the country. There were no more connections to Moscow, so someone suggested flying to Kaliningrad and then crossing the border on foot. I was travelling with my older son, people helped us a lot. The situation only changed online. There I immediately became a 'Russian'.

*J: You mention the family, its welfare. Isn't that a mere excuse?*

MR: It isn't.

*J: Or did you, however, act cynically and choose the money you could have earned in Russian clubs? The former deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Marcin Przydacz, once called them ""bloody"".*

MR: And what exactly did he say?

*J: I'll quote his entry from June 2022: ""There is nothing more embarrassing than hiding behind +family welfare+ when it is simply about big money. And it's blood money"".*

MR: This is the Minister's opinion. He was entitled to it. But actually, you can answer one question for me: why should I have left Russia?

*J: Everyone will find a different reason.*

MR: But I ask you: why do you think I should have left then?

*J: Because it is immoral to make Russian money in the middle of a war, when thousands of people, including children, are dying in Ukraine, when the world discovers massacres like the one in Bucha.*

MR: But am I doing anyone any harm?

*J: You don't have to run around the forest with a rifle and shoot to do harm.*

MR: After all, I am doing the same thing I did before the war.

*J: Circumstances have changed, however. Before there was no war, now there is.*

MR: **I understand**, anyone in my position would have had the right to make their decision. I made mine. Not under the pressure of people or posts on the Internet, but according to my conscience. I like life in Russia, in Moscow. I quickly acclimatised there, got to know the language, the people, who are my friends. The family feels comfortable there. **But, unfortunately, war broke out... Some time ago, when I was flying on holiday, the seat next to me was taken by Anatoly Tymoshchuk, a legend of the Ukrainian national team.** **After the war he stayed in St Petersburg. He is in a similar situation to me, he has a Russian wife, children who were born there. And he had similar dilemmas.** Someone will say that we made a lot of money, so we could move to Spain or Cyprus at any time. **We probably could, but it would be starting life all over again**. Nothing pleasant, especially for the children.

*J: Do they understand what is happening around Dad?*

MR: Probably not, the sons are too young. But Lana regularly received offensive posts. In Polish, Russian, English. She went through hell. But she's an Ossetian from Vladikavkaz, women there are very strong.

*J: Doesn't war raise the temperature in your home? You're a Pole, she is a Russian.*

MR: **No, we don't talk about it at all**. Even at the beginning it sometimes happened, because you know that for everyone what is happening in Ukraine was a shock, but **later we decided to avoid the subject. It may surprise someone, but we don't have Russian television in our flat. Neither do we have a Polish one. We have a TV, but we only watch Netflix, YouTube on it.**

*J: And you don't know what's going on in the world?*

MR: **I look at Twitter, but I try to avoid war topics.**

*J: It's a convenient explanation. You cover your eyes, plug your ears, and people are dying a few hundred kilometres away. And you say, ""I don't know, I'm busy.""*

MR: It's not like that. I'm experiencing it all very much. But I don't want to go crazy. I have a family to provide for, I have a job to do. Let me repeat: I am not hurting anyone by my actions.

*J: In that case, can you say outright that you condemn the war in Ukraine?*

MR: I believe that every war is evil, because every war brings death and many other terrible things. Like all reasonable people, I would prefer the world to be at peace. But, unfortunately, this is not always the case.

*J: In the summer of 2022, you had a good opportunity to change your surroundings. After five years of playing for Lokomotiv Moscow, your contract with that club came to an end. You had a card in your hand, you were the master of your fate, you could have chosen to play in another country. Why didn't you take that chance?*

MR: Because I only got one offer: from Spartak Moscow. I also had the option to extend my contract with Loko by one year, but Spartak offered a two-year contract. I had no other options. (This is a lie or he lied before. In an interview for Russian Bookmaker-Ratings a year ago he said he had a lot of offers, as [weszlo.com](https://weszlo.com/) noticed).

*J: It was only June, the beginning of the transfer window. If you had waited a few weeks, something would probably have come up.*

MR: Maybe yes, maybe no. **Spartak offered a contract for two seasons, for very good money**. **I like to have everything under control, especially in such uncertain times**. So I figured that at my age - and I was about to turn 33 - a better offer wouldn't come along.

*J: So money was the deciding factor.*

MR: Rather, it was the **stability they could guarantee us.**

*J: It never crossed your mind to leave Russia?*

MR: **Once. When Prigozhin's raid on Moscow was underway. Lana and the kids were in the capital, and I was in Kazan. We were all filled with fear.**

*J: You could move to Poland...*

MR: My dad, when he was still alive, strongly urged me to do so, especially in the first months after the war broke out. **We thought about it, but I don't know if Lana would be able to find her way in Poland.** She would be far away from her family and friends, **she wouldn't know the language**. **The same goes for our sons, who mainly speak Russian**. For them, it would be a complete novelty. I myself have not lived in Poland for a dozen or so years...

*J: So how does a Pole live in Russia?*

MR: The same as before the war.

*J: Do you not feel any hostility?*

MR: No one approaches Poles on the streets there, no fingers are pointed at us. On Christmas Eve, I went to a pastoral service in a Polish church in Moscow. It was the first time since I played in Russia. On 21 December my dad died and something inside told me to go... The service was in Polish, the majority in the church were Poles, although there were quite a few foreigners as well. So it is not that I am the only Pole in Russia. There are many. And they all function normally. I only had trouble once, before the match against Sweden. Robert Lewandowski called me. He asked if it was safe in Moscow, if we should play against the Russians. **Later the decision was made that we were boycotting the match. We were to post a graphic on Instagram declaring that we were refusing to play. I didn't think, I live in Russia, and I shared that too.** **Well, and the hejt poured in from the other side. Hundreds of messages. After fifteen minutes, I decided to delete the post.**

*J: Did you want to play with the Russians?*

MR: No, it wasn't about that. **I wanted peace of mind.**

*J: You talk about family, stability, peace of mind. Or should you admit outright that Russia is your place on earth? You went there more than ten years ago, to Grozny. Anyway, this episode of your career has also aged ugly. Today, Ramzan Kadyrov's brutal troops are fighting Ukrainians.*

MR: I didn't see this coming in 2012...

*J: This is unnecessary irony.*

MR: But what else am I supposed to answer to such a question? There were four of us at Terek: Piotrek Polczak, Marcin Komorowski, Maciek Makuszewski and me. We went to play football, not to play politics. In fact, for three of the four years we lived in Kislovodsk, a few hundred kilometres from Grozny. We only visited the city on the occasion of home matches. And it was very safe there. Sure, you could see the scars of war, damaged buildings or police patrols armed to the teeth, but in general - nothing was happening there.

*J: You did, however, meet Kadyrov. And you were in his villa.*

MR: Yes, once, with the whole team.

*J: You also got a Mercedes from him. As a birthday present when you scored two goals against Dynamo Moscow. Do you still have it today?*

MR: **Not from Kadyrov, but from Magomed Daudov, the president of Terek**. It was a gift I got not because of affection but because of my football achievements. I drove it for a year and a half and then sold it to the team manager. (Another lie he was caught on. During TV interview ""Po Gwizdku"" in 2021 he said: It was after the match against Dynamo Moscow, in which I scored two goals. Kadyrov called coach Cherchesov, who turned on the speakerphone. First I heard birthday wishes and then a promise that a present would be waiting for me when I returned to Grozny. And it was a new Mercedes).

*J: You left Chechnya after four years by moving to Lyon. However, you only lasted one season in France. And... you returned to Russia again.*

MR: At that time I could have stayed in Grozny, they offered me one million euros a year, the highest contract in Terek's history, because previously they paid a maximum of 600,000. But I refused, I wanted to try something else. Olympique was a great club, runner-up in France, they had great players like Memphis Depay, who I got on well with. I played a dozen games there, in the quarter-finals of the Europa League I scored a penalty in a series of eleven against Besiktas, in the semi-finals against Ajax Amsterdam I scored an assist. A fun adventure, but unfortunately the minutes spent on the pitch were lacking, and the World Cup in Russia, which I really wanted to go to, was approaching. So I decided to change my surroundings. A great offer came from Lokomotiv.

*J: And it was the shot of a lifetime?*

MR: Definitely. With Loko I won the championship, two cups, the super cup. I played thirteen games in the Champions League, against Bayern Munich, Juventus, Atletico Madrid. **I made a lot of money.** And I had an excellent time there, because it's a club that is far from a corporation like Spartak, for example. It's a place where I felt at home. To this day I still keep in touch with the club's staff. I am, by the way, a supporter - of Legia and Lokomotiv. **I will never regret this choice.**

*J: And the transfer to Spartak? As I mentioned before, it was a great opportunity to leave Russia. And in the end - apart from the money - you didn't gain much from the move.*

MR: Spartak is the most popular club in Russia, just like Legia in Poland has fans all over the country. Although, when I was there, there was a protest going on and attendance at the stadium was low. By contrast, when we went to other cities, Spartak supporters were in hotels, airports and shops. However, I only played a few games and although we finished third in the league, I actually cannot consider this transfer a success.

*J: In the end you ended up at Rubin Kazan, where you have not actually played since the beginning of the season.*

MR: I didn't have much choice. I only heard back from Rubin, there was also a vague enquiry from Baltika Kaliningrad. It started nicely in Kazan, because on the occasion of the match against Spartak the club representatives presented me with a bronze medal for the previous season. But in the league I played only once, a dozen minutes, just then. And to this day I am still healing the injury....

*J: If you heal it, are you still going to play in the Russian league?*

MR: We'll see. I'm not thinking that far ahead. Or maybe I won't return to playing again?

*J: Is it possible?*

MR: Everything is possible. I've been struggling with a knee injury, a muscle injury for a long time. During the winter I worked for almost two months in Turkey to get back to health, and so far everything is going in the right direction. I miss the joy of playing football, I miss the adrenaline. But some things I can't jump over. If I'm not able to play at a good level, then I'll say thank you.

*J: Then maybe you will finally leave Russia?*

MR: I haven't thought about that yet. **I used to plan to help Mariusz Piekarski as a liaison officer in the east after my career ended**. Poland's relations with Russia seemed to be correct, there was no feeling of hatred in either country. **So I thought I would live in Moscow, use my contacts, my knowledge of the language, and help organise transfers. But the war broke out**. I also planned to live for two countries, because there were up to five planes a day flying directly from Warsaw to Moscow. But the war broke out. And nothing came out of my plans again. That's why I'm not planning anything now.

*J: And if there is eventually an offer from a country other than Russia?*

MR: **I will go wherever they want me. It's not that I insisted on Russia.**

*J: You are unlikely to end your football career in Poland....*

MR: I doubt it. If I'm healthy, I think I could play another two, maybe three years. But Legia are unlikely to take me anymore.

*J: Then maybe Pelikan Łowicz, whose former junior you are?*

MR: I'd rather say no.

*J: You are unlikely to play for the Polish national team anymore either. Although as recently as March 2022 you were called up for the match against Sweden. This aroused a lot of emotion, by the way.*

MR: At that time Czesław Michniewicz called up me, Krychowiak and Szymański, who played for Dynamo. Krycha and I travelled to the national team via Kaliningrad, where we arrived by plane, and then we reached Poland by crossing the border in Bezledy. Unfortunately, the day after it turned out that I had a coronavirus and against Sweden I did not play. As it turned out - this was probably my last opportunity to play in the white-and-red jersey.

*J: How did you take Michniewicz's decision?*

MR: At first I was sad, no one would want to end with the national team in such a way. But I understood the coach. Anyway, Michniewicz called me earlier. I was just at my sister's place in Łowicz. He said he wouldn't call me up because the controversy surrounding the situation was very big, all the noise would interfere with preparations. Well, he was probably right.

*J: Did chairman of Polish FA Cezary Kulesza or Michniewicz persuade you to leave Russia and - by doing so - keep your chance to play for the national team?*

MR: This is my life and my career. Nobody is going to tell me what to do.

*J: I ask if there was pressure.*

MR: No, there was none. After all, as a Loko footballer, I received a call-up. On the other hand, I knew that it was just a matter of time that I would not be welcome on the national team. Anyway, I had some signals, my manager was also Michniewicz's agent, so leaks were reaching me.

*J: The Polish Football Association published an announcement on 20 June 2022. ""The coach informed the player that, due to his current club situation, he will not call him up for the September national team training camp and will not be taken into account when determining the composition of the team that will go to the World Cup."" In your opinion, was this a good decision by the Polish federation?*

MR: When Michniewicz called, I was not surprised. ""I said, 'Coach, I don't have any complaints'. I was already in my thirties, I wasn't playing regularly at the club, the youngsters were pushing and there was no certainty that I would go to the World Cup. I had come to terms with that. The only unpleasant thing was the thought that I would never play for the national team again.

*J: If you were sure you would go to the World Cup, would you have left Russia?*

MR: **I would certainly have considered it more seriously.**

*J: In total, you played 66 matches in the national team. Are you not expecting a farewell at the National Stadium?*

MR: No. Instead of applause, there would probably be a lot of whistling.

*J: Do you still keep in touch with your teammates?*

MR: Of course. With Kamil Glik, Kamil Grosicki, Szymański, Karol Świderski, Tomek Kędziora. I even wrote with him recently. I think each of them understands my situation.

*J: Why have you been silent for the last two years?*

MR: I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. I had dozens of interview offers from the Polish media, after matches in the mixed zons Russian journalists asked me about politics, passports. But I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to harm myself, my family. **These days one word can cause a storm. Anyway, Mario \[Piekarski\] saw for himself what a row there could be after such an interview**. Because of one, he had to delete his Twitter account. (I am not sure after which interview Piekarski deleted his account. Probably after the one where he compared Rybus's situation with a murder od Gdańsk mayor Paweł Adamowicz during charity event. Piekarski had some... controversial takes regarding Russia before).

*J: Are you no longer afraid now?*

MR: I've matured into it. I've thought some things through, I probably needed to understand. In retrospect, it's good that I didn't answer some questions in the heat of the moment. Life has many shades and sometimes it's hard to see. **I have nothing to reproach myself with**. **Over the years I have done my best to represent my country to the best of my ability and I think I didn't deserve the treatment I received after the war broke out**. But I know how it is, emotions run high, so I accept what happened.

*J: And aren't you worried that you will be remembered not for your 66 national team appearances, including the one against Germany when we won 2-0 in Warsaw, but precisely for the decision you made at the start of 2022?*

MR: I don't care about that.

*J: Everyone would like to be remembered well.*

Migration in Poland as an outstander. ,"Hello everyone!

What I’m wondering is (because internet is the internet) is Poland generally an anti-Muslim country? 
Or is it just the government? 
Or is all that talk just „against“ refugees and Islamic people still can live well in your country?

Help! Trying to move to a Polish town near nature. What do you recommend?,"I'm willing to move to the Polish countryside after visiting Bielsko Biała and Cieszyn. 

To give a little context, I'm western european, still relatively new to Poland (been here for 1 year) and can manage to hold a bit of conversational polish. 

Warsaw isn’t really for me — too big, sad and expensive. 

I'm passionate about hiking, lakes, mountains, outdoor activities and positive social communities. That’s the kind of environment I want to live: a peaceful, balanced life.

I currently work remotely and have the need to take flights to other countries occasionally. I'm looking for towns that have easier access to any of the international airports or railways for that matter.

From what I've observed:

- Average rent in Bielsko seems to be a bit overpriced (1:1 to what I currently pay here in Warsaw), while having concerning problems with air quality and smog. 

- Cieszyn, although extremely beautiful and very friendly, has the issues with the border from what I spoke with the locals.


Any recommendations of any other places to settle? Anywhere I haven't considered that I should be looking for? 

I'm heading to Bielsko next week to see some properties and meet with friends in both towns.

A random vent of love and “white guilt” from a passer by Ukrainian,"Ukrainian here who’s been living in the Middle East for the past 3 years (moved before the war). Visiting Warsaw now for the first time to see Beyonce. Been here for a week. Only visited Poland once before in 2008 (Lublin). Got a few thoughts I want to get off my chest. There isn’t a real point, just a bit of a vent, so apologies.

1) Fell in love with Warsaw. If I could, I’d spend more time here and explore more, under different circumstances. 

2) I know and have had firsthand experience of how much Poland has done and keeps doing for the UA folks crossing the border and staying. I know things have been getting strained to put it lightly. I guess this is to be expected although I wish it wasn’t. I keep learning that war is a fucked up thing and it fucks things up in ugly and unexpected ways. 

3) I feel an urge to say sorry for all the entitled assholes, for the housing and logistical collapse, the quadrupled prices, the crowds and the scams and the drunks and the constant blue and yellow in everyone’s fucking face all the time. Although I also feel like saying sorry is pathetic and useless. 

4) Just being here makes me feel like part of the problem. I feel embarrassed and out of place despite the very warm welcome. The shittiest thing is - not much can be done. All you can do is acknowledge the situation and feel awful.

5) Most of all, I want to say thank you for being the best neighbor anyone could ask for. I hope one day i can be a good neighbor too. I’m not really sure how. Host you if you ever want to visit Kyiv? Yeah absolutely. Lend a hand if you wanna move to the Middle East? I can do my best - hit me up. Donating? Hell, donating has been the word of the freaking year for most of us.

There’s not much rhyme or reason to the above, just a bit of blergh so I’ll stop here.

Join the federation?,"Hello fellow neighbors, in last couple of days on Czech and Slovak subreddit we had fun proposing we would become one country again. Apparently historically this was already once proposed with pretty unfavorable terms for you (every country has one voice, obviously unfair since there's more of you). So out of fun I wanted to hear you opinions on how this federation could look, work and what would be your requirements to accept this deal?

What we worked with so far for Czechia and Slovakia: 

-Federation inspired by Swiss model, decentralized when it comes to local policies. Therefore people would retain autonomy when it comes to things only concerning their home while we are able to show united front externally.

-Could be based from current administrative regions (like wielkopolska), cultural heritage (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia etc.) or from river basins (makes best sense geologically and there's usually good overlap culturally). 

-For federal capital was considered Brno or Olomouc for various reasons main being power balance and accessibility, if Poland was part of it Ostrava would make sense (multicultural Silesia, on borders so not dominated by any one country, railway hub, airport, large enough aglomeration with lots of free space etc.)


Benefits are many but mostly relate to increase in unity and cohesion between our populations, allowing us to work better together, strength in numbers that sort of thing. 

Significant disadvantage, we would currently weaken our voice in EU because we would have less seats. Also short term it would could be difficult adjustment, everyone blaming the other sides for their problems and so on. On the other hand long term it would strengthen ties between our peoples and make us one of the most powerful political entities within EU if handled properly.

And the most obvious benefit of all, mixture of Czech beer, Polish vodka, Slovak wine and Moravian slivovica would probably result in supersoldier cocktail making us a powerhouse of Europe 😄

"Kontekst protestu rolników, trochę liczb i faktów ze źródłami","Wiadomo, że emocje są zdecydowanie najważniejsze, a fakty czy statystyki są na drugim planie, ale mimo tego postanowiłem iść pod prąd i przedstawić trochę kontekstu odnośnie protestu rolników.

### Obecna sytuacja na rynku zbóż

W polskim proteście rolników zdecydowanie najwięcej mówi się o cenach płodów rolnych, przede wszystkim zbóż i ich imporcie z Ukrainy. Europejski zielony ład gdzieś tam się przewija, ale zdecydowanie nie jest na pierwszym miejscu w wypowiedziach rolników.

Ewidentnie główną przyczyną protestów polskich rolników jest pęknięcie bańki na rynku płodów rolnych. Warto zwrócić uwagę, że gdy rolnicy narzekają na ceny, to w swoich wypowiedziach często porównują obecne z tymi które były podczas gigantycznego skoku w okresie 2021-2022, gdy nagle ceny skoczyły o ponad 100%.

Ilość miejsca jest ograniczona, więc skupmy się na jednym przykładowym produkcie - pszenicy. Tutaj wykres cen skupu pszenicy konsumpcyjnej w Polsce w latach 2012-2024: https://i.imgur.com/Gh5Kp2p.png (źródło: [agrolok.pl](https://www.agrolok.pl/notowania/notowania-cen-pszenicy.htm), trzeba tam sobie wyklikać)

Jak widać, w latach 2012-2021 cena pszenicy konsumpcyjnej utrzymywała się stabilnie na poziomie ~700-800zł, w okresie 2021-2022 nagle wystrzeliła do poziomu 1500-2000zł a potem wróciła na ~780zł. Trzeba jednak podkreślić, że mimo iż ceny są podobne do tych sprzed trzech lat, to przez inflację siła nabywcza jest mniejsza. 780zł w 2021 r. było warte więcej niż 780zł w 2024 r.

Na marginesie, wzrosty zaczęły się na rok *przed* wybuchem wojny w Ukrainie. Ciężko wskazać ich jedną konkretną przyczynę, ale z pewnością wojna i zablokowanie portów były czynnikiem przez który ten trend zaszedł aż tak daleko.

Obecny spadek cen nie dotyczy tylko Polski czy Europy, trendy na rynkach światowych są podobne: https://i.imgur.com/vH9la2d.png (źródło: [IGC](https://www.igc.int/en/markets/marketinfo-goi.aspx), wheat sub-index).

Dane odnośnie produkcji i importu zbóż w UE można znaleźć tutaj:

https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/data-and-analysis/markets/overviews/market-observatories/crops/cereals-statistics_en

Wybrane fakty:

- Roczna produkcja pszenicy w UE utrzymuje się w granicach 120-130mln ton.

- Import pszenicy z Ukrainy w sezonie 2020/21 to 0,6 mln ton, w 2021/22 - ~0,3 mln ton, a w 2022/2023 wzrósł do ~6 mln ton (sezon to 12-miesięczny okres zaczynający się od lipca).

- Najwięksi importerzy pszenicy w UE (głównie z Ukrainy, ale nie tylko) w sezonie 2022/23 to Hiszpania (41%), Włochy (11%), Rumunia (10%), Polska (9%)

- W obecnie trwającym sezonie 2023/24, póki co najwięksi importerzy to: Hiszpania (53%), Włochy (13%), Grecja (8%), Rumunia (6%)

### Handel z Ukrainą przed 2022, DCFTA

Nie jest tak, że przed 2022 nie było żadnego handlu z Ukrainą, wręcz przeciwnie. W 2017 weszła w życie [pogłębiona i kompleksowa strefa wolnego handlu (DCFTA)](https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/content/eu-ukraine-deep-and-comprehensive-free-trade-area) między Unią Europejską i (między innymi) Ukrainą. W ramach DCFTA przez ostatnie lata stopniowo znoszono cła na ponad 90% produktów, zarówno przy eksporcie z Ukrainy do UE, jak i w drugą stronę. Przykładowo ziarna soi, [które nasi rolnicy niedawno wysypali na tory](https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2024-02-24/ukrainska-soja-wysypana-z-wagonu-reaguje-wicepremier-ukrainy/), już od 2017 roku nie były objęte cłem.

Niektóre produkty, np. pszenica (w kierunku z Ukrainy do UE), zamiast całkowitego zniesienia cła, zostały objęte kontyngentem celnym (ang. tariff quota). Działa to tak, że produkt jest zwolniony z cła tylko do jakiejś ilości. W przypadku pszenicy roczny limit to 1 milion ton (nr. kontyngentu 09.4306).

Żywność importowana do Unii Europejskiej z krajów zewnętrznych musi spełniać takie same normy jak żywność produkowana w UE. Według regulacji UE, [obowiązkowa kontrola na granicy dotyczy tylko produktów wysokiego ryzyka](https://food.ec.europa.eu/horizontal-topics/official-controls-and-enforcement/imported-products_en). Do takich produktów zaliczają się m.in. żywe zwierzęta, nieprzetworzone produkty pochodzenia zwierzęcego, owoce czy nasiona (ze względu na ryzyko przenoszenia chorób roślin). Większość produktów przetworzonych/złożonych oraz nasiona nieprzeznaczone do siewu (czyli zboża) nie zaliczają się do tej grupy.

Oczywiście, w przypadku pojawienia się jakichś zagrożeń, istnieje możliwość wprowadzania dodatkowych kontroli dla konkretnych produktów. W załączniku I do [rozporządzenia 2019/1793](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/pl/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R1793) znajduje się lista produktów objętych tymczasowym zwiększeniem kontroli.

Nie oznacza to, że produkty niepodlegające obowiązkowym badaniom na granicy, w ogóle nie podlegają żadnej kontroli. Mamy coś takiego jak urzędowa kontrola żywności, w Polsce odpowiada za to m.in. Sanepid i Inspekcja Jakości Handlowej Artykułów Rolno-Spożywczych.

Warto wspomnieć, że w UE funkcjonuje system wczesnego ostrzegania o niebezpiecznej żywności i paszach (RASFF). Wszelkie zagrożenia, w tym wystąpienia niedozwolonych substancji, są w nim notowane. System jest publiczny, ostrzeżenia można [wyszukiwać tutaj](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window). Szczególnie polecam przejrzeć ostrzeżenia na temat żywności z Polski ;)

### Jak zmieniały się warunki handlu z Ukrainą po 2022

W czerwcu 2022, w celu pomocy gospodarce broniącej się Ukrainy, [Unia Europejska zawiesiła cła na towary importowane z tego kraju](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_562). W praktyce oznaczało to m.in. zniesienie limitu na bezcłowy eksport zbóż do UE, czyli poszerzenie tego co wcześniej dawało DCFTA.

Nieprawdą jest, że wydano jedynie zezwolenie na tranzyt. Jednak równocześnie podjęto działania w celu transportu Ukraińskiego zboża na rynki poza UE, w ramach tzw. [""Solidarity Lanes""](https://eu-solidarity-ukraine.ec.europa.eu/eu-assistance-ukraine/eu-ukraine-solidarity-lanes_en). W ten sposób przetransportowano do tej pory ponad 60 mln ton rozmaitych zbóż i nasion.

Pod wpływem nacisków rolników, w kwietniu 2023 Polska zapowiedziała jednostronne embargo na import produktów rolnych z Ukrainy, co [weszło w życie 22 kwietnia 2023](https://www.gov.pl/web/kas/tranzyt-produktow-rolnych-z-ukrainy-przez-polske). Embargo zezwalało na tranzyt produktów przez Polskę, ale zabroniało sprzedawania ich w Polsce. Miało trwać przez miesiąc, do 30 czerwca 2023. Podobne embarga nałożyły [Węgry i Słowacja](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/slovakia-joins-poland-hungary-halting-ukraine-grain-imports).

Wkrótce potem wynegocjowano to samo na poziomie Unii Europejskiej, [tymczasowy zakaz eksportu zbóż](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2562) do Bułgarii, Polski, Rumunii, Słowacji i Węgier. Obowiązywał od 2 maja do 15 czerwca, potem został przedłużony do 15 września, a [następnie zniesiony](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4497). W odpowiedzi, Polska ponownie [wprowadziła jednostronne embargo](https://www.gov.pl/web/premier/interesy-polskiej-wsi-sa-dla-nas-najwazniejsze--podtrzymamy-zakaz-wwozu-produktow-zbozowych-z-ukrainy-po-15-wrzesnia-2023-r), podobnie zrobiły [Słowacja i Węgry](https://tvn24.pl/tvn24-news-in-english/poland-hungary-slovakia-to-continue-ban-on-ukrainian-grain-after-eu-lifts-restrictions-7345813). Natomiast [Bułgaria zniosła ograniczenia](https://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-to-drop-ban-on-ukrainian-grain-imports/), a Rumunia [porozumiała się z Ukrainą](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/grain-exports-gentlemans-agreement-between-romanian-and-ukrainian-pms/).

Granica z Ukrainą jest obecnie zablokowana przez protestujących rolników. Premier Ukrainy [zaproponował pięciopunktowy plan porozumienia](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/969317.html), jednym z jego elementów jest kontynuacja zakazu eksportu zbóż do Polski. Jednocześnie zapowiedział, że jeśli granica nie zostanie odblokowana do 28 marca, to Ukraina [może zastosować ""środki lustrzane"" wobec Polski](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/969318.html).

### Czy rolnicy na zachodzie protestują w tej samej sprawie?

Rolnicy w Niemczech protestują przede wszystkim [przeciw zabraniu im zwolnień z podatków od paliw i maszyn rolniczych](https://www.euronews.com/2024/01/15/farmers-in-germany-decry-plans-to-scrap-diesel-tax-breaks).

Francuscy rolnicy mają bardziej szerokie postulaty. Protestują przeciw m.in. [niskim cenom](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240221-french-pm-attal-promises-new-law-on-prices-to-appease-angry-farmers), dodatkowym [normom użycia pestycydów](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240202-french-govt-slammed-for-putting-pesticide-phase-out-on-hold), [zagranicznej konkurencji i umowom wolnego handlu](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-stopped-mercosur-talks-amid-farmers-protests-france-says/) (we Francji mówi się głównie o umowie z Mercosur, związkiem krajów Ameryki Południowej).",Polska,2024-02-25 11:23:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/1azlplh/kontekst_protestu_rolników_trochę_liczb_i_faktów/,"Kontekst protestu rolników, trochę liczb i faktów ze źródłami Wiadomo, że emocje są zdecydowanie najważniejsze, a fakty czy statystyki są na drugim planie, ale mimo tego postanowiłem iść pod prąd i przedstawić trochę kontekstu odnośnie protestu rolników.

Przykładowo ziarna soi, [które nasi rolnicy niedawno wysypali na tory](https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2024-02-24/ukrainska-soja-wysypana-z-wagonu-reaguje-wicepremier-ukrainy/), już od 2017 roku nie były objęte cłem.

Niektóre produkty, np. pszenica (w kierunku z Ukrainy do UE), zamiast całkowitego zniesienia cła, zostały objęte kontyngentem celnym (ang. tariff quota). Działa to tak, że produkt jest zwolniony z cła tylko do jakiejś ilości. W przypadku pszenicy roczny limit to 1 milion ton (nr. kontyngentu 09.4306).

Żywność importowana do Unii Europejskiej z krajów zewnętrznych musi spełniać takie same normy jak żywność produkowana w UE. Według regulacji UE, [obowiązkowa kontrola na granicy dotyczy tylko produktów wysokiego ryzyka](https://food.ec.europa.eu/horizontal-topics/official-controls-and-enforcement/imported-products_en). Do takich produktów zaliczają się m.in. żywe zwierzęta, nieprzetworzone produkty pochodzenia zwierzęcego, owoce czy nasiona (ze względu na ryzyko przenoszenia chorób roślin). Większość produktów przetworzonych/złożonych oraz nasiona nieprzeznaczone do siewu (czyli zboża) nie zaliczają się do tej grupy.

Oczywiście, w przypadku pojawienia się jakichś zagrożeń, istnieje możliwość wprowadzania dodatkowych kontroli dla konkretnych produktów. W załączniku I do [rozporządzenia 2019/1793](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/pl/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R1793) znajduje się lista produktów objętych tymczasowym zwiększeniem kontroli.

Nie oznacza to, że produkty niepodlegające obowiązkowym badaniom na granicy, w ogóle nie podlegają żadnej kontroli. Mamy coś takiego jak urzędowa kontrola żywności, w Polsce odpowiada za to m.in. Sanepid i Inspekcja Jakości Handlowej Artykułów Rolno-Spożywczych.

Warto wspomnieć, że w UE funkcjonuje system wczesnego ostrzegania o niebezpiecznej żywności i paszach (RASFF). Wszelkie zagrożenia, w tym wystąpienia niedozwolonych substancji, są w nim notowane. System jest publiczny, ostrzeżenia można [wyszukiwać tutaj](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window). Szczególnie polecam przejrzeć ostrzeżenia na temat żywności z Polski ;)

### Jak zmieniały się warunki handlu z Ukrainą po 2022

W czerwcu 2022, w celu pomocy gospodarce broniącej się Ukrainy, [Unia Europejska zawiesiła cła na towary importowane z tego kraju](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_562). W praktyce oznaczało to m.in. zniesienie limitu na bezcłowy eksport zbóż do UE, czyli poszerzenie tego co wcześniej dawało DCFTA.

Nieprawdą jest, że wydano jedynie zezwolenie na tranzyt. Jednak równocześnie podjęto działania w celu transportu Ukraińskiego zboża na rynki poza UE, w ramach tzw. [""Solidarity Lanes""](https://eu-solidarity-ukraine.ec.europa.eu/eu-assistance-ukraine/eu-ukraine-solidarity-lanes_en). W ten sposób przetransportowano do tej pory ponad 60 mln ton rozmaitych zbóż i nasion.

Pod wpływem nacisków rolników, w kwietniu 2023 Polska zapowiedziała jednostronne embargo na import produktów rolnych z Ukrainy, co [weszło w życie 22 kwietnia 2023](https://www.gov.pl/web/kas/tranzyt-produktow-rolnych-z-ukrainy-przez-polske). Embargo zezwalało na tranzyt produktów przez Polskę, ale zabroniało sprzedawania ich w Polsce. Miało trwać przez miesiąc, do 30 czerwca 2023. Podobne embarga nałożyły [Węgry i Słowacja](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/slovakia-joins-poland-hungary-halting-ukraine-grain-imports).

Wkrótce potem wynegocjowano to samo na poziomie Unii Europejskiej, [tymczasowy zakaz eksportu zbóż](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2562) do Bułgarii, Polski, Rumunii, Słowacji i Węgier. Obowiązywał od 2 maja do 15 czerwca, potem został przedłużony do 15 września, a [następnie zniesiony](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_4497). W odpowiedzi, Polska ponownie [wprowadziła jednostronne embargo](https://www.gov.pl/web/premier/interesy-polskiej-wsi-sa-dla-nas-najwazniejsze--podtrzymamy-zakaz-wwozu-produktow-zbozowych-z-ukrainy-po-15-wrzesnia-2023-r), podobnie zrobiły [Słowacja i Węgry](https://tvn24.pl/tvn24-news-in-english/poland-hungary-slovakia-to-continue-ban-on-ukrainian-grain-after-eu-lifts-restrictions-7345813). Natomiast [Bułgaria zniosła ograniczenia](https://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-to-drop-ban-on-ukrainian-grain-imports/), a Rumunia [porozumiała się z Ukrainą](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/grain-exports-gentlemans-agreement-between-romanian-and-ukrainian-pms/).

Granica z Ukrainą jest obecnie zablokowana przez protestujących rolników. Premier Ukrainy [zaproponował pięciopunktowy plan porozumienia](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/969317.html), jednym z jego elementów jest kontynuacja zakazu eksportu zbóż do Polski. Jednocześnie zapowiedział, że jeśli granica nie zostanie odblokowana do 28 marca, to Ukraina [może zastosować ""środki lustrzane"" wobec Polski](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/969318.html).

### Czy rolnicy na zachodzie protestują w tej samej sprawie?

Rolnicy w Niemczech protestują przede wszystkim [przeciw zabraniu im zwolnień z podatków od paliw i maszyn rolniczych](https://www.euronews.com/2024/01/15/farmers-in-germany-decry-plans-to-scrap-diesel-tax-breaks).

Francuscy rolnicy mają bardziej szerokie postulaty. Protestują przeciw m.in. [niskim cenom](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240221-french-pm-attal-promises-new-law-on-prices-to-appease-angry-farmers), dodatkowym [normom użycia pestycydów](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240202-french-govt-slammed-for-putting-pesticide-phase-out-on-hold), [zagranicznej konkurencji i umowom wolnego handlu](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-stopped-mercosur-talks-amid-farmers-protests-france-says/) (we Francji mówi się głównie o umowie z Mercosur, związkiem krajów Ameryki Południowej).",negative

Czy przymusowe wysyłanie na wojnę ludzi przed nią uciekających jest w porządku?,"W piątek przed Bożym Narodzeniem Estonia [zapowiedziała](https://polskieradio24.pl/5/1223/artykul/3304903,estonia-jest-gotowa-odsylac-ukraincow-w-wieku-poborowym-wiemy-gdzie-przebywaja) gotowość do wysłania na wojnę ukraińskich mężczyzn w wieku poborowym, którzy właśnie przed wojną uciekli i złożyli w Estonii wnioski o tymczasową ochronę.

Tylko mi się wydaje, że to jest tak samo potworne, jak – nie wiem – oddanie ofiary przemocy w ręce sprawcy, i to w sytuacji, kiedy ów sprawca otwarcie twierdzi, że wciąż będzie ją krzywdził?

Może wygląda to dla mnie tak, ponieważ pochodzę z Ukrainy? Mieszkam w Polsce od ponad pięciu lat, nauczyłem się języka, mam tu rodzinę i przyjaciół, ale niestety nie mam jeszcze obywatelstwa polskiego (można się o nie ubiegać dopiero po ośmiu latach pobytu).

Wyjechałem z Ukrainy ponad dziesięć lat temu, ponieważ ten kraj – w odróżnieniu od Polski – nie dał mi w życiu nic dobrego. Teraz jednak to skorumpowane i bezprawne państwo, które nigdy o mnie nie dbało, wzywa mnie, żebym oddał zań życie – i być może moja rodzina też, ponieważ moi bliscy są na moim utrzymaniu i beze mnie nie będą mogli zostać w Polsce. W jakim chorym świecie to może być postrzegane jako sprawiedliwe?

Oczywiście, zdaję sobie sprawę z tego, że moja sytuacja nieco się różni od sytuacji mężczyzn, którzy wyjechali po 24 lutego 2022 roku. Wciąż jednak nie rozumiem, w jakim świecie odesłanie ich z powrotem może być postrzegane jako coś normalnego; jako coś, ze zrobienia czego, według ministra spraw wewnętrznych Estonii, należy „cieszyć się”. Zwłaszcza że jest całkiem możliwe, że wbrew twierdzeniom władz Ukrainy żaden z tych mężczyzn nie złamał prawa.

Status prawny zakazu wyjazdu z Ukrainy dla mężczyzn w wieku poborowym budzi kontrowersje wśród ukraińskich prawników. Artykuł 33 konstytucji Ukrainy stanowi, że „każdemu, kto przebywa na terytorium Ukrainy zgodnie z prawem, przysługuje wolność poruszania się, swobodny wybór miejsca zamieszkania oraz prawo dobrowolnego opuszczenia terytorium Ukrainy, z wyjątkiem ograniczeń określonych w ustawie”. Jednak żadna istniejąca obecnie ustawa nie zawiera zakazu wyjazdu dla mężczyzn. Wyznał to nawet Sąd Najwyższy Ukrainy w swoim [orzeczeniu z dnia 17 sierpnia 2023 roku](https://sud.ua/uk/news/publication/280111-verkhovnyy-sud-khotya-i-svoboda-peredvizheniya-mozhet-byt-ogranichena-tolko-zakonom-no-sposob-realizatsii-gosudarstvom-prav-i-svobod-grazhdan-opredelyaetsya-potrebnostyu-mobilizatsii-oboronnykh-chelovecheskikh-resursov). Istnieje wyłącznie rozporządzenie, które nie ma mocy prawnej. Tak [twierdzą](https://tsn.ua/exclusive/yuridichniy-kazus-advokat-stverdzhuye-scho-zakonu-po-zaboroni-viyizdu-za-kordon-cholovikam-nemaye-2401315.html) przynajmniej niektórzy prawnicy.

Nie jestem prawnikiem i nie mogę stwierdzić, kto tu ma rację. Jest natomiast pewne, że nie jest to tak jednoznaczne i oczywiste, jak twierdzi rząd Ukrainy. Pozostaje tylko mieć nadzieję, że w końcu tą sprawą zajmie się Europejski Trybunał Praw Człowieka, ponieważ w sprawiedliwość ukraińskich sądów nie wierzą sami Ukraińcy – zgodnie z [wynikami przeprowadzonego w grudniu sondażu](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=1335), tylko 12% Ukraińców ufa sądom.

Zgodnie z inną [analizą prawną](https://telegra.ph/ZHittya-lyudini-chi-zahist-Ukraini-SHCHo-ye-prior%D1%96tetnim-z-pravovoi-tochki-zoru-01-30), w ukraińskiej konstytucji nie ma obowiązku obrony kraju z bronią w ręku. Według adwokata Ołeksandra Gumirowa konstytucja Ukrainy wyraźnie rozróżnia pojęcia obrony oraz obrony z bronią w ręku – w języku ukraińskim są to dwa różne słowa – i jeśli pierwsze rzeczywiście jest obowiązkiem każdego obywatela, to drugie – już nie.

Nie ulega też wątpliwości, że konstytucja Ukrainy zakazuje dyskryminacji ze względu na płeć. W praktyce jednak prawa ukraińskich mężczyzn są ograniczone w dużo większym stopniu niż ukraińskich kobiet. Oczywiście nie sugeruję, że Ukraina miałaby ograniczyć również prawa kobiet, tylko że powinna przestać łamać prawa mężczyzn.

A to się dzieje cały czas. W ukraińskim internecie krąży ogromna ilość filmików ([\[1\]](https://news.liga.net/ua/all/video/mobilizatsiya-so-strelboy-kogda-zakonchatsya-skandaly-s-voenkomatami), [\[2\]](https://www.unian.ua/incidents/u-lvovi-rozgorivsya-skandal-cherez-vikradennya-viyskkomami-cholovika-reakciya-tck-video-novini-lvova-12422109.html), [\[3\]](https://tsn.ua/exclusive/ostanni-guchni-skandali-iz-tck-u-lvovi-scho-vidbuvayetsya-u-viyskkomati-ta-yak-mozhna-vidmovitisya-vid-povistki-2456053.html), [\[4\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMt4eWOHcc0), [\[5\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_CF_jheoFE), [\[6\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9TIWpt1DjU), [\[7\]](https://radiotrek.rv.ua/news/skazheno-bili-mobilizovanih-u-ternopoli-pracivniki-viyskkomatu-ne-pomitili-shcho-yih-znimayut-i-gamselili-cholovikiv-video_315490.html) – to tylko kilka przykładów tego, co trafiło do dużych mediów), na których wojskowi z komisji poborowych łapią mężczyzn na ulicy, biją ich, grożą bronią, siłą wciągają do samochodów. Nie muszę chyba mówić, że to też nie jest zgodne z prawem.

Do tego dochodzi korupcja. Jeśli na początku komisje poborowe po prostu brały łapówki od chętnych, to teraz dochodzi do tego, że – nazwijmy to po imieniu – wymuszają okupy. Kiedy zaś w tym miesiącu zaproponowano dodanie do ustawy wysłanie tych skorumpowanych wojskowych z komisji poborowych na front w ramach rotacji, stanowczo [się temu sprzeciwiło](https://sud.ua/uk/news/publication/288738-stalo-izvestno-kakie-zamechaniya-predostavil-valeriy-zaluzhnyy-k-zakonoproektu-ob-usilenii-mobilizatsii-dokument) wyższe dowództwo wojskowe.

Ktoś mógłby powiedzieć, że to wszystko jest wewnętrzną sprawą Ukrainy. Nie zgadzam się z tą opinią, ale potrafię ją zrozumieć. Jednak już od kilku miesięcy władze Ukrainy próbują wciągnąć do tego haniebnego procederu kraje UE, ciągle mówiąc o ściganiu ukraińskich mężczyzn za granicą i ściągnięciu ich z powrotem do kraju. I jeśli dotąd reakcja krajów UE była zdecydowanie zgodna z prawem unijnym i międzynarodowym, czyli negatywna, to teraz Estonia stwarza bardzo zły precedens.

Wbrew prawu unijnemu i międzynarodowemu, które jednoznacznie zakazuje ekstradycji ludzi do kraju, który nie jest w stanie zapewnić im ani bezpieczeństwa, ani sprawiedliwego procesu sądowego, co więcej, otwarcie twierdzi, że wcieli ich siłą do wojska, Estonia zamierza tego właśnie dokonać.

Czy tak ma postępować kraj należący do Unii Europejskiej opartej na poszanowaniu życia i godności ludzi? Czy Estonia już wycofała swój podpis pod Europejską Konwencją Praw Człowieka? Czy może ci nieszczęśni Ukraińcy według Estończyków nie są ludźmi, tylko mięsem armatnim mającym powstrzymać Rosję przed teoretycznym atakiem na samą Estonię?

Zwolenników podobnych rozwiązań nie brakuje i w Polsce. Na przykład generał Waldemar Skrzypczak już od pary miesięcy [powtarza](https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/ukraincy-z-polski-zostana-wezwani-na-front-burza-polityczna-u-sasiadow-bo-szukaja-500-tys-osob-6976519455922688a), że Polska ma to zrobić.

Czuję się bardzo bezsilny. Z tą estońską wiadomością załamał się cały mój świat, cała moja wiara w europejski system prawny oraz europejskie wartości, w tym poszanowanie podstawowych praw człowieka.

Mam jednak silną nadzieję, że Polska pozostanie takim krajem, który pokochałem i świadomie wybrałem jako swoją nową ojczyznę, i nie potraktuje mnie oraz inne osoby pochodzenia ukraińskiego jako mięso armatnie wyłącznie dlatego, że mieliśmy pecha urodzić się w niewłaściwym miejscu. Mam również nadzieję, że Unia Europejska też stanie na wysokości zadania i nie dopuści, żeby Estonia w tak rażący sposób złamała prawo międzynarodowe i podstawowe prawa człowieka.

Kiedy zaś w tym miesiącu zaproponowano dodanie do ustawy wysłanie tych skorumpowanych wojskowych z komisji poborowych na front w ramach rotacji, stanowczo [się temu sprzeciwiło](https://sud.ua/uk/news/publication/288738-stalo-izvestno-kakie-zamechaniya-predostavil-valeriy-zaluzhnyy-k-zakonoproektu-ob-usilenii-mobilizatsii-dokument) wyższe dowództwo wojskowe.

Ktoś mógłby powiedzieć, że to wszystko jest wewnętrzną sprawą Ukrainy. Nie zgadzam się z tą opinią, ale potrafię ją zrozumieć. Jednak już od kilku miesięcy władze Ukrainy próbują wciągnąć do tego haniebnego procederu kraje UE, ciągle mówiąc o ściganiu ukraińskich mężczyzn za granicą i ściągnięciu ich z powrotem do kraju. I jeśli dotąd reakcja krajów UE była zdecydowanie zgodna z prawem unijnym i międzynarodowym, czyli negatywna, to teraz Estonia stwarza bardzo zły precedens.

Wbrew prawu unijnemu i międzynarodowemu, które jednoznacznie zakazuje ekstradycji ludzi do kraju, który nie jest w stanie zapewnić im ani bezpieczeństwa, ani sprawiedliwego procesu sądowego, co więcej, otwarcie twierdzi, że wcieli ich siłą do wojska, Estonia zamierza tego właśnie dokonać.

Czy tak ma postępować kraj należący do Unii Europejskiej opartej na poszanowaniu życia i godności ludzi? Czy Estonia już wycofała swój podpis pod Europejską Konwencją Praw Człowieka? Czy może ci nieszczęśni Ukraińcy według Estończyków nie są ludźmi, tylko mięsem armatnim mającym powstrzymać Rosję przed teoretycznym atakiem na samą Estonię?

Zwolenników podobnych rozwiązań nie brakuje i w Polsce. Na przykład generał Waldemar Skrzypczak już od pary miesięcy [powtarza](https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/ukraincy-z-polski-zostana-wezwani-na-front-burza-polityczna-u-sasiadow-bo-szukaja-500-tys-osob-6976519455922688a), że Polska ma to zrobić.

Czuję się bardzo bezsilny. Z tą estońską wiadomością załamał się cały mój świat, cała moja wiara w europejski system prawny oraz europejskie wartości, w tym poszanowanie podstawowych praw człowieka.

Mam jednak silną nadzieję, że Polska pozostanie takim krajem, który pokochałem i świadomie wybrałem jako swoją nową ojczyznę, i nie potraktuje mnie oraz inne osoby pochodzenia ukraińskiego jako mięso armatnie wyłącznie dlatego, że mieliśmy pecha urodzić się w niewłaściwym miejscu. Mam również nadzieję, że Unia Europejska też stanie na wysokości zadania i nie dopuści, żeby Estonia w tak rażący sposób złamała prawo międzynarodowe i podstawowe prawa człowieka.

Nie oczekiwałem takiego zainteresowania moim wpisem. Dziękuję wszystkim, którzy nie pozostali obojętni i napisali, że nie zgadzają się z takim postępowaniem i uważają, że nie jest to w porządku. To wiele znaczy dla mnie i prawdopodobnie dla wielu Ukraińców w Polsce.

Bardzo często hipotetyczna wojna jest postrzegana zero-jedynkowo, albo jest pokój, albo Rosja próbuje przeprowadzić blitzkrieg do Lizbony. Rzeczywistość jest bardziej skomplikowana, między tymi dwoma stanami jest duża przestrzeń. Konflikty mogą eskalować stopniowo i eskalacja może się na jakimś etapie zatrzymać. Konflikt może być ograniczony zarówno w skali, jak i do jakiegoś obszaru.

Spójrzmy na przykład na [konflikt radziecko-chiński z 1969r.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict) Starcia miały miejsce bezpośrednio na terenie tych państw, to nie była *wojna pośrednia*. Obie strony posiadały broń jądrową. Niektórzy oczekiwaliby, że niczym w memach o ""Artykule 5"", po pierwszym wystrzale obie strony rzuciłyby na siebie wszystko co mają, a w Moskwie i Pekinie zobaczylibyśmy atomowe grzyby. Tak się nie stało. Starcia były ograniczone do terenów przygranicznych i brała w nich udział niewielka ilość żołnierzy. W zależności od źródła, zginęło od kilkudziesięciu do kilkuset osób. Nie było dalszej eskalacji. Po kilku miesiącach doszło do rozmów i konflikt się zakończył.

W 1999 wybuchła [wojna między Pakistanem a Indiami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War). Było to niespełna rok po przeprowadzeniu przez Pakistan testów broni jądrowej. Konflikt jednak nie rozrósł się do pełnoskalowej wojny, walki były ograniczone do spornego Kaszmiru, głównie dystryktu Kargil. Zginęło ponad tysiąc osób.

Na przełomie 2020 i 2021 doszło do [serii starć na granicy chińsko-indyjskiej](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_China%E2%80%93India_skirmishes). Zginęło w nich kilkadziesiąt osób.

Korea Północna od czasu do czasu ostrzeliwuje Koreę Południową, ostatni raz [niecały miesiąc temu](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67889551). W tym wypadku pociski spadły na strefę buforową i obyło się bez ofiar. Ale nie zawsze tak było. W 2010, podczas [ostrzału wyspy Yeonpyeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Yeonpyeong_bombardment) zginęły cztery osoby. Jak odpowiedział Seul? Również ostrzałem. Nie było eskalacji do pełnoskalowej wojny i działania zakończyły się w ciągu jednego dnia.

Gdy do Polski wleciała rosyjska rakieta Ch-55, nasz rząd próbował to zataić. [Podobnie było z Shahedami w Rumunii](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/09/6/7418690/). Pamiętamy też białoruski helikopter. Najprawdopodobniej nie były to celowe ataki, jednak nasza reakcja pokazuje, że nie palimy się do eskalacji. Na pewno nie jest jak w 1914, gdy każdy tylko czekał na pretekst do wojny, np. na zabójstwo jakiegoś arcyksięcia.

Pojawiają się pytania: jaka byłaby reakcja NATO np. na krótkotrwały ostrzał jakiejś wsi na Podlasiu? Zrzucenie bomby atomowej na Moskwę? Zajęcie strefy buforowej w Białorusi? Zniszczenie jednostki która dokonała ostrzału? Oddanie paru strzałów na ślepo? Sankcje? Ostre słowa? Nic?

A jaka byłaby odpowiedź np. na zajęcie kilku wsi w Estonii? Albo na wybuch pseudopowstania Rosjan na Łotwie?

Odpowiedź na te pytania jest ważna, bo ustanawia precedens i wpłynie na dalsze kroki Rosji. Odpowiedź na pewno będzie zależała od warunków politycznych. Na przykład, gdyby wszystkie kraje w NATO były rządzone przez klony Orbana, to raczej nie byłoby co liczyć na stawianie się Rosji. I dlatego w interesie Rosji jest wspieranie tego typu polityków. 

Silne NATO może odstraszać Rosję od agresywnych działań. Ale trzeba pamiętać, że siła sojuszu nie bierze się tylko z zapisów w umowach i wielkości armii, ale przede wszystkim z wiarygodności. Dobrym przykładem niewiarygodnego sojuszu jest ""sojusz"" Rosji z Armenią. Teoretycznie, Rosja jest zobowiązana do obrony Armenii. W praktyce ten sojusz nie odstrasza Azerbejdżanu, bo Azerbejdżan wie, że Rosja ma w dupie bezpieczeństwo Armenii. I dlatego martwi podejście Trumpa (i jemu podobnych) do NATO.

## Błędne przekonania o wojnie w Ukrainie

Istnieje dużo błędnych przekonań o tej wojnie.

**Po pierwsze** i najważniejsze, w 2022 Ukraina wcale nie była słabym państewkiem. Na początku wojny mieli bezsprzecznie drugą najsilniejszą armię lądową w Europie. W 1991 odziedziczyli po ZSRR magazyny pełne (wówczas) nowoczesnej broni. Więcej ciężkiego sprzętu, artylerii i systemów przeciwlotniczych niż mają Polska, Niemcy, UK i Francja *razem wzięte*. Szczególnie to ostatnie im pomogło. Gdyby rosyjskie lotnictwo mogło operować bez przeszkód, ta wojna wyglądałaby zupełnie inaczej.

**Po drugie**, skala rozbrojenia Europy po 1991 jest niewyobrażalna. Naprawdę zalecam wszystkim przejrzeć ile sprzętu na stanie mają europejskie ""potęgi"". Przykładowo, przed 1991, Francja miała na służbie >1000 czołgów, >1000 BWP i setki haubic. Dzisiaj to ~200 czołgów, ~600 BWP i 100 haubic. Wysłanie 18 CEASARów na Ukrainę może się wydawać skromnym podarkiem, ale to była 1/4 tego co mieli.

Niektórzy myślą, że Europa ma jakieś wielkie ukryte magazyny z bronią. Nie ma. Dostawy na Ukrainę zwolniły, bo zapasy się kończą.

Zaraz ktoś powie ""ale oni stawiają na nowoczesne, precyzyjne rakiety, a nie jakaś tam przestarzała artyleria"". Tak, tak. Mają zawrotne 11 sztuk wyrzutni rakiet M270 (było 13, ale dwie oddali Ukrainie). Ale spokojnie! Planują do 2030 [dokupić dodatkowe 13](https://www.armyrecognition.com/defense_news_october_2023_global_security_army_industry/french_ground_force_seeking_artillery_system_with_a_range_of_500_km.html).

Podkreślam, że to są liczby na papierze. W rzeczywistości nie wszystko jest sprawne i do tego brak amunicji jest powszechnym problemem w Europie. Zobaczmy na przykład co RUSI miało do powiedzenia o zapasach Wielkiej Brytanii [w swoim raporcie z 2022](https://static.rusi.org/359-SR-Ukraine-Preliminary-Lessons-Feb-July-2022-web-final.pdf):

>It is abundantly clear that the British military is woefully deficient in its stockpiles across domains. At the height of the fighting in Donbas, Russia was using more ammunition in two days than the entire British military has in stock. At Ukrainian rates of consumption, British stockpiles would potentially last a week.

Z resztą, nie potrzeba raportów by o tym wiedzieć. Warto przypomnieć jak podczas interwencji w Libii w 2011, UK i Francji po kilku dniach [skończyła się amunicja](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html) i musieli prosić USA o pomoc.

[W Polsce nie jest lepiej](https://www.gazetaprawna.pl/wiadomosci/kraj/artykuly/9299710,pociski-155-mm-maja-wreszcie-wypalic.html):

>Jeszcze dwa lata temu, przed wybuchem wojny, Wojsko Polskie praktycznie nie miało zapasów amunicji 155 mm, było to mniej niż 30 tys. sztuk – tyle zużywa się obecnie na froncie w mniej niż tydzień. Tymczasem do niedawna zdolności PGZ do jej produkcji wynosiły, optymistycznie licząc, 30 tys. rocznie. Trudność polega na tym, że jest ona oparta na zagranicznych poddostawcach, a doświadczenie ze Wschodu pokazuje, że to w czasie wojny staje się poważnym problemem.

Zapasów brak, a przemysł obronny jest słaby. [Unii Europejskiej nie udało się](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/14/ukraine-artillery-shells-eu-target-germany-boris-pistorius) wypełnić (dość skromnego) rocznego planu dostarczenia miliona sztuk amunicji 155mm. Tak na marginesie, to według Ukraińskiego MONu [potrzebują 7 milionów rocznie](https://www.ft.com/content/75ee9701-aa93-4c5d-a1bc-7a51422280fd).

BTW, Korea Północna [przekazała Rosji ponad milion pocisków](https://www.politico.eu/article/north-korea-outpacing-the-eu-on-shell-supplies/), czyli więcej niż cała UE planowała (ale nie da rady) dać do marca.

**Po trzecie**, ludzie nie rozumieją skali tej wojny. Weźmy na przykład czołgi. Według Oryxa, [Rosja do tej pory straciła ponad 2500 czołgów](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html). Dwa tysiące pięćset. Większość z tego to w miarę współczesne czołgi, rola przestarzałych T-62 i T-55 była dość niewielka. I mimo tych strat, wciąż pozwalają sobie na rzucanie więcej ciężkiego sprzętu na front.

Według [wrześniowego raportu](https://www.foi.se/rest-api/report/FOI%20Memo%208231) FOI (Szwedzkiej Agencji Badań Obronnych, podległej ich Ministerstwu Obrony) *dolny* szacunek produkcji/modernizacji czołgów przez Rosję to 480 sztuk rocznie:

>The dark violet curve assumes that Russia can add 480 units a year to its stock through new production or modernisation. This figure is based on the maximum numbers for each of the T-72, T-80, or T-90, tank models delivered in any single year occurring between 2009 and 2019. This figure may appear conservative or modest given other assumptions about Russia’s increase in military production since the invasion.

Dla porównania, jeśli chodzi o zachodnie czołgi, to Ukraina otrzymała po dużych oporach ~100 Leopardów 2, 14 Challengerów 2 i ~30 Abramsów. Nie powinno być zaskoczenia, że to nie był żaden game changer.

Oczywiście czołgi to tylko przykład, inne liczby też są duże. Np. [według szacunków RUSI](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-ukrainian-drones-cause-traffic-jams-in-donetsk-region-report-2023-8) z maja 2023, Ukraina traci około 10 tysięcy dronów miesięcznie.

Wydaje się mało prawdopodobne by jakikolwiek europejski kraj samodzielnie wytrzymał tydzień w sytuacji Ukrainy. Nikt nie jest przygotowany do wojny lądowej na taką skalę. Dlatego NATO, szczególnie jego europejska część, musi się zbroić.

PS. Strasznie drażni mnie nazywanie ""ruskimi trollami"" osób które mówią o zagrożeniu Rosją. Jest wręcz przeciwnie. W interesie Rosji jest żeby Europa bagatelizowała zagrożenie i dalej olewała zbrojenia.

Czasami dochodzi do błędnych interpretacji, gdy niektórzy twierdzą, że jest to forma rosyjskiego imperializmu, jednak Rosja nie ma nad tym językiem monopolu – stworzył go Czech i Holender, który poślubił Polkę i zna język polski. Co więcej, język ten może przyczynić się do eliminacji kulturowego wpływu rosyjskiego i pomóc w zacieśnianiu więzi między państwami takimi jak Polska, Ukraina, Czechy, Chorwacja, Bułgaria, Bośnia czy Słowenia, ułatwiając relacje między krajami oraz międzyludzkie, co może wspierać rozwój gospodarczy, społeczny i kulturalny.

"Protest rolników na granicy - o co chodzi, kto to robi, kto na tym zyskuje?","👉 W ostatnim czasie protesty rolników, które w zachodniej Europie odbywały się od wielu miesięcy, zawitały także do Polski. I od razu zalała nas fala sprzecznych newsów, dezinformacji, emocjonalnych uniesień i prezentowana radykalnych politycznych poglądów przedstawianych jako fakty. Spróbuję Wam ten temat przybliżyć i nieco go rozwikłać, bowiem sprawa jest poważna i dotyczy bezpieczeństwa państwa. Szczególnie, że w protest zaangażowały się środowiska skarpetosceptyczne.

👉 Zacznijmy od początku. Unia Europejska od kilku lat forsuje projekt redukcji emisyjności swojej gospodarki. Celem jest, aby wspólnota osiągnęła zeroemisyjność (czyli, żeby generować tyle CO2 ile jest naturalnie pochłaniane przez biosferę) do roku 2050. Ten największy program to Europejski Zielony Ład, który wyznacza ramy całego przedsięwzięcia na następne 26 lat. Zielony Ład dotyczy wielu kwestii, np. produkcji energii, produkcji przemysłowej czy motoryzacji. A także rolnictwa, które odpowiada za istotny procent emisji (10,5% w roku 2018 [1]). To jest, że tak powiem, Duży Projekt.

👉 Zielony Ład (Duży Projekt) składa się z szeregu mniejszych koncepcji. W tym Wspólnej Polityki Rolnej (która ma ujednolicić politykę rolną w państwach UE) oraz koncepcji “Fit for 55” (która zakłada zmniejszenie emisji CO2 o 55% do roku 2030, więc można myśleć o niej jako o Mniejszym Projekcie, albo Podprojekcie). [2] Ważne, by tych trzech pojęć nie mylić. Polecam ten artykuł Konkret24, gdzie jest to dokładnie wyjaśnione [3]. Są w nim odnośniki do dokumentów programowych tych koncepcji, a także wypowiedzi polityków PiS na ten temat, do czego zaraz wrócę.

👉 Jak przy każdym projekcie transformacyjnym, pojawiają się uzasadnione obawy, że pewne grupy będą pokrzywdzone. Nie inaczej jest i w tej kwestii. Rolnicy w różnych europejskich krajach argumentują, że proponowane rozwiązania są zbyt restrykcyjne, co ma uderzyć w ich przedsiębiorstwa, a w konsekwencji doprowadzić do radykalnego wzrostu cen lub wręcz załamania produkcji żywności w UE [7]. Z tego powodu, przez ostatnie kilka lat rolnicy protestowali w różnych europejskich krajach od Holandii [4], Niemczech [5], a ostatnio także we Francji [6]. A także w Polsce, już w 2019 czy 2022 roku [3]. 

👉 To jest ogólnoeuropejskie tło. I teraz ważne rozróżnienie: otóż w Polsce, OPRÓCZ TEGO, mamy drugą warstwę problemu, jaką jest import ukraińskich płodów rolnych. Ciąg przyczynowo skutkowy wygląda w największym skrócie następująco. Ukraina to wielki producent żywności. Rosja zablokowała (później: znacząco ograniczyła) Ukrainie możliwość eksportu płodów drogą morską. Więc w maju 2022 roku, Unia zniosła cła na importowane z Ukrainy zboża, by ułatwić ich wywiezienie drogą lądową [8]. Zgodnie z przewidywaniami wielu, zboża z Ukrainy nie szły przez Polskę tranzytem, tylko rozchodziły się na pniu na naszym rynku, gdyż były znacznie tańsze [9]. Z tego powodu, w zeszłym roku Unia na kilka miesięcy zakazała importu, po czym ten zakaz zdjęła [10][11]. Zatem ukraińskie zboże ponownie popłynęło do UE, ponownie będąc znacznie tańsze od tego produkowanego przez unijnych rolników, w tym Polaków.

👉 Zrozummy zatem dobrze, co się dzieje. W całej Unii rolnicy protestują przede wszystkim przeciwko celom klimatycznym UE w dziedzinie rolnictwa. Ale w Polsce ważniejszy wydaje się aspekt wwożenia ukraińskiego zboża, które jest znacząco tańsze od polskiego. Dlatego równolegle dzieją się dwie rzeczy. Rolnicy protestują w kilkuset miejscach w całym kraju, w tym w dużych miastach jak Wrocław [12][13]. A równolegle, zablokowali przejścia graniczne z Ukrainą [14]. I tu dochodzimy do kluczowego aspektu całej sprawy.

👉 Do tego momentu mamy dwie warstwy tortu: protest europejskich (w tym polskich) rolników przeciwko unijnej polityce oraz protest tylko polskich rolników przeciwko importowi ukraińskiego zboża. Na tak przygotowany podkład kładziemy teraz kolejne warstwy: polityczną wojnę PiSu z resztą świata, kretyńską próbę zaistnienia przez Konfederację, aktywność środowisk antysystemowych i skarpetosceptycznych, klasyczną pseudopatriotyczną histerię, postępującą anarchię oraz niekompetencję państwa i mediów. Całość polewamy lukrem putinowskiej propagandy i przystrajamy wisienką destabilizującej państwo prowokacji. I cyk, mamy transgraniczny tort dezinformacyjny, którego spożycie źle może odbić się czkawką całemu regionowi. Proszę podawać z otwartym na Kremlu szampanem.
Popatrzmy na te warstwy po kolei.

👉 PiS kontra Unia, KO i… eee… PiS…
Oczywiście, że to wykorzystują, by mówić, że oto przyszedł nowy rząd, który z czystej nienawiści do rolników (soli tej ziemi, podstawy gospodarki itd.) postanowił spełnić szatański plan UE i zagłodzić Polaków. Nagle przypomnieli sobie, że oni są przecież przeciwko tej całej zielonej transformacji, choć to ich rząd jeszcze rok temu ją współtworzył, ich premier zachwalał ją jako doskonale zgodną z pisowskim programem rolniczym, wreszcie to ich unijny komisarz był przedstawiany jako jego autor. Oczywiście, to przeszłość. Teraz logika etapu jest taka, że to KO i inni europosłowie spoza PiS zagłosowali w 2019 za Zielonym Ładem, więc to ich wina. Bo PiS akurat ten jeden raz głosował przeciw, choć później już projekt chwalił [3]. Przy okazji politycy zarówno PiS, jak i KO, notorycznie mylą wymienione na początku unijne programy, potęgując chaos [3].  Oczywiście taka retoryka działa bardzo destabilizująco, bo podgrzewa nastroje, cóż, wywrotowe. No bo skoro rząd chce zniszczyć polskie rolnictwo, to trzeba dać odpór, prawda? A taki Mariusz Błaszczak już wezwał do pełnego embarga na wszystkie ukraińskie towary rolne, choć ledwie jeszcze przed chwilą był członkiem rządu, który nie potrafił zorganizować tranzytu i doprowadził do zalania naszego rynku tymi właśnie produktami [19].

👉 Konfederacja.
W odróżnieniu od PiS, Konfederosjanie nie mają teraz zbyt wiele na głowie, za to bardzo potrzebują zaistnieć przed wyborami. Dlatego o ile dla Kaczyńskiego blokada to jeden temat z wielu, o tyle chłopcy wjechali w to jak dzik w żołędzie. Serio, wejdźcie na jakiekolwiek social media Konfy, a zobaczycie niemal tylko ten protest. A taki poseł Ryszard Wilk (nie mylić z Jackiem Wilkiem) to nawet zrobił Potężną Interwencję Poselską, w trakcie której ze spiętymi pośladkami podszedł do wysypanej kukurydzy, pokazał ją do kamery, po czym schował do kieszeni, nie wiadomo właściwie po co. [17] Ale wracając: jednym z organizatorów jest Rafał Mekler, szef lubelskich struktur Konfy. Mekler, co charakterystyczne dla tej partii, ma obsesję na punkcie Bandery, twierdzi, że ukraińscy imigranci “zmieniają skład Polski” i powiela narracje o bajecznie bogatych uchodźcach, którzy wożą się drogimi autami. Używa też pięknej, importowanej z Rosji nazwy “Unia Gejropejska” [42]. Podobnie jak swego czasu Krzysiu Bosak, w imieniu nas wszystkich, wystawił nawet Ukrainie rachunek za pomoc na skromną kwotę 100 miliardów złotych [15]. Rachunek do dziś wisi zresztą na stronie Konfederacji [16]. Innym organizatorem i samozwańczym trybunem ludowym został niejaki Hubert Ojdana, który oczywiście również startował z list Konfy [18] oraz ma na koncie wypowiedzi chwalące perspektywę rosyjskiego zwycięstwa [20]. Ojdana już został zresztą konfederackim męczennikiem, bo ma jakoby dostawać pogróżki od ukraińskich służb [21].  Konfederatów można by wymieniać długo, ja tylko wskażę antyszczepionkową braunistkę Karolinę Pikułę, która nazywa sytuację “egzekucją na narodzie polskim”, a która właśnie została kandydatką tej partii na fotel prezydenta Rzeszowa [28].
Co ciekawe, Konfederaci dużo mówią o jakości ukraińskiego zboża, które ma być niby zatrute, spleśniałe i tak dalej. Jakbym był złośliwy, to bym przypomniał wypowiedzi różnych Sośnierzy o tym, że kontrola sanitarna to lewactwo, ale nie jestem złośliwy.

👉 Skarpetosceptycy
Środowisko Konfederacji oczywiście płynnie przenika się z już jawnie proputinowskimi aktywistami. Na granicy pojawił się już szereg znanych kremlowskich propagandystów, którzy nagle bardzo zainteresowali się rolnictwem. Mamy więc Jerzego Andrzejewskiego z niedawno utworzonej przez ekspierta od gieopolityki Leszka Sykulskiego partii Bezpieczna Polska, który to Andrzejewski z lawety nawoływał do pokoju i honoru, powielił narracje o zastępowaniu hodowli świń robakami, stwierdził, że tęskni za “zamordowanym” “najlepszym Polakiem”, czyli za Andrzejem Lepperem, a obecne działania wrażych sił nazwał terroryzmem, który zniszczy Polskę [22]. Zresztą Bezpieczna Polska również aktywnie wspiera protest [25][27]. Sam Sykulski, który oczywiście uważa się za pacyfistę, twierdzi, że stoimy przed wyborem: albo dogadamy się z Rosją i Białorusią, albo dostaniemy żywność z Ukrainy i “LGBT gender z Zachodu” [24]. Andrzejewskiemu towarzyszy także Piotr Panasiuk [23], którego social media polecam każdemu, kto chce się zapoznać z aktualnymi liniami propagandowymi Kremla. Aktywny medialnie jest także np. Roland Dubowski, autor Myśli Polskiej [44] były działacz Obozu Wielkiej Polski, który nie mógł być na miejscu, bo akurat upamiętniał radzieckich żołnierzy na Warmii, oczywiście w towarzystwie rosyjskiego ambasadora, a także byłych działaczy Zmiany: Piskorskiego i Jankowskiego [26]. Dodajmy, że relacje z przejścia w Dorohusku robiła znana telewizja dezinformacyjna, trzymajta się,  MIR tv [36]. Dodajmy, że relacje dla tej telewizji robi między innymi Marzanna Gontarska. Pozwolę Wam zgadnąć z jakiej partii kandydowała [38]. Protest zdaje się koordynować Instytut Gospodarki Rolnej. Wbrew nazwie, nie jest to instytucja rządowa, tylko prywatny think-tank, należący do potentata branży futrzarskiej, zaprzyjaźnionego z Rydzykiem milionera Szczepana Wójcika [43].

👉 Histeria.
Przypomnijmy najpierw, co się właściwie dzieje. Rolnicy w całej Europie boją się, że unijne regulacje uderzą w ich biznesy. Zostawiam na boku, na ile tak rzeczywiście będzie - mają prawo się tego bać i być źli. Z drugiej strony, polscy rolnicy boją się, że dumpingowe ceny ukraińskich płodów rolnych uderzą w ich biznesy. Mają prawo się tego bać i być źli. Jedni i drudzy mają prawo protestować. Ale jeden i drugi problem są do załatwienia na drodze zwykłych zmian legislacyjnych. Na przykład jakiś czas temu w niemal podobny sposób Unia zapewniła mechanizm osłonowy dla górników, a wobec rolników już poszła na pewne ustępstwa [7]. Kwestia importu ukraińskiego zboża od początku miała być załatwiona inaczej - to zboże miało iść przez Polskę tranzytem na rynki pozaunijne. Nie wiem jak łatwo lub trudno jest to wprowadzić, ale wprowadzenie tego w zasadzie rozwiązuje problem, a rozmowy między Warszawą, a Kijowem są jakoby na finiszu [34]. Tyle fakty. Jednak z powodu aktywności PiS, Konfederacji i skarpetosceptyków, a także przez nieudolność (także medialną) rządu, w mediach społecznościowych rozlewa się obraz protestu jako niemal nowego powstania narodowego. Idąc za przykładem francuskiego artysty, który z pomocą sztucznej inteligencji tworzył obrazki z rolnikami zasypującymi Paryż zbożem [30], w polskich socialach roi się od podobnych grafik. Na jednej kolumna rolników idzie pod flagą naprzód, wiedziona przez ogromnego orła. Obok wzruszające zdjęcie dziecka na mini-traktorze, pozdrawiającego protestujących polską flagą. Obok nawołyawnie do obalenia rządu [31]. Na drugim, chyba z tej samej sesji w Midjourneyu, orzeł prowadzi kolumnę oflagowanych traktorów [32]. Na kolejnej stary rolnik roni łzy nad kiełkami zboża, w tle polskie flagi powiewają nad złotymi łanami [33]. I tak dalej, do znudzenia. Zwykły protest (duży, ale nadal zwykły), jakich w Polsce nie brakowało za każdego rządu, nagle urasta do rangi antypaństwowej rebelii. Podziały się pogłębiają. Głębokie przekonania o opresyjnych rządzie i Unii wbijają się do głów. Władimir Władimirowicz lubi to. 

👉 Anarchia.
Powyższe zjawiska już do niej doprowadziły, przynajmniej lokalnie. Jacyś samozwańczy strażnicy patrolują okolicę i uciekają przed “karkami” [41]. Ktoś otwiera i wysypuje ukraińskie zboże [35]. Ktoś robi  kontrole ukraińskich tirów. Ktoś twierdzi, że w samochodach-chłodniach przewożona jest broń, ktoś, że to “żywność bez kolejki” [37][39]. Ktoś publikuje zdjęcia spleśniałej kukurydzy, twierdząc, że to ta przywieziona z Ukrainy, czego nie da się zweryfikować, ale to autorom nie przeszkadza w mówieniu, że nas trują [40][41]. Taka sytuacja jest niedopuszczalna w żadnym miejscu, ale na granicy, w dodatku tej, w dodatku teraz - jest to po prostu porażka państwa. Mówimy o zewnętrznej granicy Unii i NATO. W dodatku o granicy, przez którą przechodzi sprzęt wojskowy i pomoc humanitarna dla walczącej z rosyjskim imperializmem Ukrainy. Każde spowolnienie tych dostaw cieszy tylko jeden kraj: Rosję. Nie można nie panować nad takim miejscem [48]. Tymczasem wygląda na to, że w ogólnym uniesieniu umyka, że po okolicy swobodnie biegają znani prorosyjscy działacze, antycovidowi szaleńcy oraz… kto? No właśnie w sumie nie wiadomo. W takich okolicznościach bardzo łatwo o…

👉 Prowokacje.
Już miały miejsce. Poza wspomnianymi wyżej samozwańczymi kontrolami, na proteście pojawiają się treści antyukraińskie, które przywołują wspomnienia z wiosny 2022 roku. Mamy więc porównywanie obecnej sytuacji do, jakżeby inaczej, Wołynia [45]. Mamy popularną dwa lata temu grafikę z polskim ludzikiem wykopującym z konturowej mapy Polski ludzika ukraińskiego, podpisaną “koniec gościny, niewdzięczne skur…” [46]. Wszystkie te działania mają na celu to samo. Skłócić nas z Ukraińcami, przekonać nas, że w naszym interesie jest, aby Ukraina przegrała. Przekonać nas do konieczności “dogadania się z Rosją”. A także, co nie mniej ważne, przekonać Ukraińców, że jesteśmy ich wrogami, na których nie można liczyć. Przy okazji, sytuacja na granicy już jest grzana w rosyjskich mediach jako “dowód” na społeczny opór przeciwko wsparciu dla Ukrainy, co zresztą wraca do nas w postaci niewiele zmienionych narracji [47]. To się dzieje naprawdę niewielkimi środkami, a może być bardzo skuteczne. Niestety, państwo na razie nad tym nie panuje, a media skupiają się na samym fakcie istnienia protestów, nie poświęcając zbytniej uwagi temu, kto w nich bierze udział.

👉 Podsumujmy.
Transformacja energetyczna UE może uderzyć w rolnictwo europejskie. A import taniego ukraińskiego zboża bez unijnych atestów, uderza w rolnictwo polskie. Ale to są rzeczy do załatwienia na płaszczyźnie prawnej, z uwzględnieniem postulatów grupy interesu, jaką są rolnicy. Natomiast na tym fundamencie, wyrosła nam megalityczna budowla antyeuropejskich, antyukraińskich i jawnie prorosyjskich kłamstw, manipulacji i pseudopatriotycznej histerii. Prosta rzecz została obudowana emocjonalnymi narracjami o sięgających daleko konsekwencjach geopolitycznych. Protest rolników jest wykorzystywany instrumentalnie przez polityczne partie (PiS, ale przede wszystkim Konfederację), ruchy jawnie prorosyjskie, zwykłych prowokatorów oraz samozwańczych szeryfów, którzy nie wiadomo kogo reprezentują. Oraz przez kremlowską propagandę, która z lubością pokaże wszystkim (Polakom, Ukraińcom, Rosjanom), że ta cała Europa stoi na progu jakiejś wojny domowej pomiedzy uciśnionymi obywatelami a opresyjnymi rządami. 

Władimir Władimirowicz lubi to. I to bardzo.

W tym Wspólnej Polityki Rolnej (która ma ujednolicić politykę rolną w państwach UE) oraz koncepcji “Fit for 55” (która zakłada zmniejszenie emisji CO2 o 55% do roku 2030, więc można myśleć o niej jako o Mniejszym Projekcie, albo Podprojekcie). [2] Ważne, by tych trzech pojęć nie mylić. Polecam ten artykuł Konkret24, gdzie jest to dokładnie wyjaśnione [3]. Są w nim odnośniki do dokumentów programowych tych koncepcji, a także wypowiedzi polityków PiS na ten temat, do czego zaraz wrócę.

👉 Jak przy każdym projekcie transformacyjnym, pojawiają się uzasadnione obawy, że pewne grupy będą pokrzywdzone. Nie inaczej jest i w tej kwestii. Rolnicy w różnych europejskich krajach argumentują, że proponowane rozwiązania są zbyt restrykcyjne, co ma uderzyć w ich przedsiębiorstwa, a w konsekwencji doprowadzić do radykalnego wzrostu cen lub wręcz załamania produkcji żywności w UE [7]. Z tego powodu, przez ostatnie kilka lat rolnicy protestowali w różnych europejskich krajach od Holandii [4], Niemczech [5], a ostatnio także we Francji [6]. A także w Polsce, już w 2019 czy 2022 roku [3]. 

👉 To jest ogólnoeuropejskie tło. I teraz ważne rozróżnienie: otóż w Polsce, OPRÓCZ TEGO, mamy drugą warstwę problemu, jaką jest import ukraińskich płodów rolnych. Ciąg przyczynowo skutkowy wygląda w największym skrócie następująco. Ukraina to wielki producent żywności. Rosja zablokowała (później: znacząco ograniczyła) Ukrainie możliwość eksportu płodów drogą morską. Więc w maju 2022 roku, Unia zniosła cła na importowane z Ukrainy zboża, by ułatwić ich wywiezienie drogą lądową [8]. Zgodnie z przewidywaniami wielu, zboża z Ukrainy nie szły przez Polskę tranzytem, tylko rozchodziły się na pniu na naszym rynku, gdyż były znacznie tańsze [9]. Z tego powodu, w zeszłym roku Unia na kilka miesięcy zakazała importu, po czym ten zakaz zdjęła [10][11]. Zatem ukraińskie zboże ponownie popłynęło do UE, ponownie będąc znacznie tańsze od tego produkowanego przez unijnych rolników, w tym Polaków.

👉 Zrozummy zatem dobrze, co się dzieje. W całej Unii rolnicy protestują przede wszystkim przeciwko celom klimatycznym UE w dziedzinie rolnictwa. Ale w Polsce ważniejszy wydaje się aspekt wwożenia ukraińskiego zboża, które jest znacząco tańsze od polskiego. Dlatego równolegle dzieją się dwie rzeczy. Rolnicy protestują w kilkuset miejscach w całym kraju, w tym w dużych miastach jak Wrocław [12][13]. A równolegle, zablokowali przejścia graniczne z Ukrainą [14]. I tu dochodzimy do kluczowego aspektu całej sprawy.

👉 Do tego momentu mamy dwie warstwy tortu: protest europejskich (w tym polskich) rolników przeciwko unijnej polityce oraz protest tylko polskich rolników przeciwko importowi ukraińskiego zboża. Na tak przygotowany podkład kładziemy teraz kolejne warstwy: polityczną wojnę PiSu z resztą świata, kretyńską próbę zaistnienia przez Konfederację, aktywność środowisk antysystemowych i skarpetosceptycznych, klasyczną pseudopatriotyczną histerię, postępującą anarchię oraz niekompetencję państwa i mediów. Całość polewamy lukrem putinowskiej propagandy i przystrajamy wisienką destabilizującej państwo prowokacji. I cyk, mamy transgraniczny tort dezinformacyjny, którego spożycie źle może odbić się czkawką całemu regionowi. Proszę podawać z otwartym na Kremlu szampanem.
Popatrzmy na te warstwy po kolei.

👉 PiS kontra Unia, KO i… eee… PiS…
Oczywiście, że to wykorzystują, by mówić, że oto przyszedł nowy rząd, który z czystej nienawiści do rolników (soli tej ziemi, podstawy gospodarki itd.) postanowił spełnić szatański plan UE i zagłodzić Polaków. Nagle przypomnieli sobie, że oni są przecież przeciwko tej całej zielonej transformacji, choć to ich rząd jeszcze rok temu ją współtworzył, ich premier zachwalał ją jako doskonale zgodną z pisowskim programem rolniczym, wreszcie to ich unijny komisarz był przedstawiany jako jego autor. Oczywiście, to przeszłość. Teraz logika etapu jest taka, że to KO i inni europosłowie spoza PiS zagłosowali w 2019 za Zielonym Ładem, więc to ich wina. Bo PiS akurat ten jeden raz głosował przeciw, choć później już projekt chwalił [3]. Przy okazji politycy zarówno PiS, jak i KO, notorycznie mylą wymienione na początku unijne programy, potęgując chaos [3].  Oczywiście taka retoryka działa bardzo destabilizująco, bo podgrzewa nastroje, cóż, wywrotowe. No bo skoro rząd chce zniszczyć polskie rolnictwo, to trzeba dać odpór, prawda? A taki Mariusz Błaszczak już wezwał do pełnego embarga na wszystkie ukraińskie towary rolne, choć ledwie jeszcze przed chwilą był członkiem rządu, który nie potrafił zorganizować tranzytu i doprowadził do zalania naszego rynku tymi właśnie produktami [19].

👉 Konfederacja.
W odróżnieniu od PiS, Konfederosjanie nie mają teraz zbyt wiele na głowie, za to bardzo potrzebują zaistnieć przed wyborami. Dlatego o ile dla Kaczyńskiego blokada to jeden temat z wielu, o tyle chłopcy wjechali w to jak dzik w żołędzie. Serio, wejdźcie na jakiekolwiek social media Konfy, a zobaczycie niemal tylko ten protest. A taki poseł Ryszard Wilk (nie mylić z Jackiem Wilkiem) to nawet zrobił Potężną Interwencję Poselską, w trakcie której ze spiętymi pośladkami podszedł do wysypanej kukurydzy, pokazał ją do kamery, po czym schował do kieszeni, nie wiadomo właściwie po co. [17] Ale wracając: jednym z organizatorów jest Rafał Mekler, szef lubelskich struktur Konfy. Mekler, co charakterystyczne dla tej partii, ma obsesję na punkcie Bandery, twierdzi, że ukraińscy imigranci “zmieniają skład Polski” i powiela narracje o bajecznie bogatych uchodźcach, którzy wożą się drogimi autami. Używa też pięknej, importowanej z Rosji nazwy “Unia Gejropejska” [42]. Podobnie jak swego czasu Krzysiu Bosak, w imieniu nas wszystkich, wystawił nawet Ukrainie rachunek za pomoc na skromną kwotę 100 miliardów złotych [15]. Rachunek do dziś wisi zresztą na stronie Konfederacji [16]. Innym organizatorem i samozwańczym trybunem ludowym został niejaki Hubert Ojdana, który oczywiście również startował z list Konfy [18] oraz ma na koncie wypowiedzi chwalące perspektywę rosyjskiego zwycięstwa [20]. Ojdana już został zresztą konfederackim męczennikiem, bo ma jakoby dostawać pogróżki od ukraińskich służb [21].  Konfederatów można by wymieniać długo, ja tylko wskażę antyszczepionkową braunistkę Karolinę Pikułę, która nazywa sytuację “egzekucją na narodzie polskim”, a która właśnie została kandydatką tej partii na fotel prezydenta Rzeszowa [28].
Co ciekawe, Konfederaci dużo mówią o jakości ukraińskiego zboża, które ma być niby zatrute, spleśniałe i tak dalej. Jakbym był złośliwy, to bym przypomniał wypowiedzi różnych Sośnierzy o tym, że kontrola sanitarna to lewactwo, ale nie jestem złośliwy.

👉 Skarpetosceptycy
Środowisko Konfederacji oczywiście płynnie przenika się z już jawnie proputinowskimi aktywistami. Na granicy pojawił się już szereg znanych kremlowskich propagandystów, którzy nagle bardzo zainteresowali się rolnictwem. Mamy więc Jerzego Andrzejewskiego z niedawno utworzonej przez ekspierta od gieopolityki Leszka Sykulskiego partii Bezpieczna Polska, który to Andrzejewski z lawety nawoływał do pokoju i honoru, powielił narracje o zastępowaniu hodowli świń robakami, stwierdził, że tęskni za “zamordowanym” “najlepszym Polakiem”, czyli za Andrzejem Lepperem, a obecne działania wrażych sił nazwał terroryzmem, który zniszczy Polskę [22]. Zresztą Bezpieczna Polska również aktywnie wspiera protest [25][27]. Sam Sykulski, który oczywiście uważa się za pacyfistę, twierdzi, że stoimy przed wyborem: albo dogadamy się z Rosją i Białorusią, albo dostaniemy żywność z Ukrainy i “LGBT gender z Zachodu” [24]. Andrzejewskiemu towarzyszy także Piotr Panasiuk [23], którego social media polecam każdemu, kto chce się zapoznać z aktualnymi liniami propagandowymi Kremla. Aktywny medialnie jest także np. Roland Dubowski, autor Myśli Polskiej [44] były działacz Obozu Wielkiej Polski, który nie mógł być na miejscu, bo akurat upamiętniał radzieckich żołnierzy na Warmii, oczywiście w towarzystwie rosyjskiego ambasadora, a także byłych działaczy Zmiany: Piskorskiego i Jankowskiego [26]. Dodajmy, że relacje z przejścia w Dorohusku robiła znana telewizja dezinformacyjna, trzymajta się,  MIR tv [36]. Dodajmy, że relacje dla tej telewizji robi między innymi Marzanna Gontarska. Pozwolę Wam zgadnąć z jakiej partii kandydowała [38]. Protest zdaje się koordynować Instytut Gospodarki Rolnej. Wbrew nazwie, nie jest to instytucja rządowa, tylko prywatny think-tank, należący do potentata branży futrzarskiej, zaprzyjaźnionego z Rydzykiem milionera Szczepana Wójcika [43].

👉 Histeria.
Przypomnijmy najpierw, co się właściwie dzieje. Rolnicy w całej Europie boją się, że unijne regulacje uderzą w ich biznesy. Zostawiam na boku, na ile tak rzeczywiście będzie - mają prawo się tego bać i być źli. Z drugiej strony, polscy rolnicy boją się, że dumpingowe ceny ukraińskich płodów rolnych uderzą w ich biznesy. Mają prawo się tego bać i być źli. Jedni i drudzy mają prawo protestować. Ale jeden i drugi problem są do załatwienia na drodze zwykłych zmian legislacyjnych. Na przykład jakiś czas temu w niemal podobny sposób Unia zapewniła mechanizm osłonowy dla górników, a wobec rolników już poszła na pewne ustępstwa [7]. Kwestia importu ukraińskiego zboża od początku miała być załatwiona inaczej - to zboże miało iść przez Polskę tranzytem na rynki pozaunijne. Nie wiem jak łatwo lub trudno jest to wprowadzić, ale wprowadzenie tego w zasadzie rozwiązuje problem, a rozmowy między Warszawą, a Kijowem są jakoby na finiszu [34]. Tyle fakty. Jednak z powodu aktywności PiS, Konfederacji i skarpetosceptyków, a także przez nieudolność (także medialną) rządu, w mediach społecznościowych rozlewa się obraz protestu jako niemal nowego powstania narodowego. Idąc za przykładem francuskiego artysty, który z pomocą sztucznej inteligencji tworzył obrazki z rolnikami zasypującymi Paryż zbożem [30], w polskich socialach roi się od podobnych grafik. Na jednej kolumna rolników idzie pod flagą naprzód, wiedziona przez ogromnego orła. Obok wzruszające zdjęcie dziecka na mini-traktorze, pozdrawiającego protestujących polską flagą. Obok nawołyawnie do obalenia rządu [31]. Na drugim, chyba z tej samej sesji w Midjourneyu, orzeł prowadzi kolumnę oflagowanych traktorów [32]. Na kolejnej stary rolnik roni łzy nad kiełkami zboża, w tle polskie flagi powiewają nad złotymi łanami [33]. I tak dalej, do znudzenia. Zwykły protest (duży, ale nadal zwykły), jakich w Polsce nie brakowało za każdego rządu, nagle urasta do rangi antypaństwowej rebelii. Podziały się pogłębiają. Głębokie przekonania o opresyjnych rządzie i Unii wbijają się do głów. Władimir Władimirowicz lubi to. 

👉 Anarchia.
Powyższe zjawiska już do niej doprowadziły, przynajmniej lokalnie. Jacyś samozwańczy strażnicy patrolują okolicę i uciekają przed “karkami” [41]. Ktoś otwiera i wysypuje ukraińskie zboże [35]. Ktoś robi  kontrole ukraińskich tirów. Ktoś twierdzi, że w samochodach-chłodniach przewożona jest broń, ktoś, że to “żywność bez kolejki” [37][39]. Ktoś publikuje zdjęcia spleśniałej kukurydzy, twierdząc, że to ta przywieziona z Ukrainy, czego nie da się zweryfikować, ale to autorom nie przeszkadza w mówieniu, że nas trują [40][41]. Taka sytuacja jest niedopuszczalna w żadnym miejscu, ale na granicy, w dodatku tej, w dodatku teraz - jest to po prostu porażka państwa. Mówimy o zewnętrznej granicy Unii i NATO. W dodatku o granicy, przez którą przechodzi sprzęt wojskowy i pomoc humanitarna dla walczącej z rosyjskim imperializmem Ukrainy. Każde spowolnienie tych dostaw cieszy tylko jeden kraj: Rosję. Nie można nie panować nad takim miejscem [48]. Tymczasem wygląda na to, że w ogólnym uniesieniu umyka, że po okolicy swobodnie biegają znani prorosyjscy działacze, antycovidowi szaleńcy oraz… kto? No właśnie w sumie nie wiadomo. W takich okolicznościach bardzo łatwo o…

👉 Prowokacje.
Już miały miejsce. Poza wspomnianymi wyżej samozwańczymi kontrolami, na proteście pojawiają się treści antyukraińskie, które przywołują wspomnienia z wiosny 2022 roku. Mamy więc porównywanie obecnej sytuacji do, jakżeby inaczej, Wołynia [45]. Mamy popularną dwa lata temu grafikę z polskim ludzikiem wykopującym z konturowej mapy Polski ludzika ukraińskiego, podpisaną “koniec gościny, niewdzięczne skur…” [46]. Wszystkie te działania mają na celu to samo. Skłócić nas z Ukraińcami, przekonać nas, że w naszym interesie jest, aby Ukraina przegrała. Przekonać nas do konieczności “dogadania się z Rosją”. A także, co nie mniej ważne, przekonać Ukraińców, że jesteśmy ich wrogami, na których nie można liczyć. Przy okazji, sytuacja na granicy już jest grzana w rosyjskich mediach jako “dowód” na społeczny opór przeciwko wsparciu dla Ukrainy, co zresztą wraca do nas w postaci niewiele zmienionych narracji [47]. To się dzieje naprawdę niewielkimi środkami, a może być bardzo skuteczne. Niestety, państwo na razie nad tym nie panuje, a media skupiają się na samym fakcie istnienia protestów, nie poświęcając zbytniej uwagi temu, kto w nich bierze udział.

👉 Podsumujmy.
Transformacja energetyczna UE może uderzyć w rolnictwo europejskie. A import taniego ukraińskiego zboża bez unijnych atestów, uderza w rolnictwo polskie. Ale to są rzeczy do załatwienia na płaszczyźnie prawnej, z uwzględnieniem postulatów grupy interesu, jaką są rolnicy. Natomiast na tym fundamencie, wyrosła nam megalityczna budowla antyeuropejskich, antyukraińskich i jawnie prorosyjskich kłamstw, manipulacji i pseudopatriotycznej histerii. Prosta rzecz została obudowana emocjonalnymi narracjami o sięgających daleko konsekwencjach geopolitycznych. Protest rolników jest wykorzystywany instrumentalnie przez polityczne partie (PiS, ale przede wszystkim Konfederację), ruchy jawnie prorosyjskie, zwykłych prowokatorów oraz samozwańczych szeryfów, którzy nie wiadomo kogo reprezentują. Oraz przez kremlowską propagandę, która z lubością pokaże wszystkim (Polakom, Ukraińcom, Rosjanom), że ta cała Europa stoi na progu jakiejś wojny domowej pomiedzy uciśnionymi obywatelami a opresyjnymi rządami. 

Władimir Władimirowicz lubi to. I to bardzo.

trolle w internecie i social mediach,"Chciałbym zwrócić uwagę na problem, który niestety ostatnio nabiera rozpędu. Mam na myśli działalność rosyjskich trolli internetowych, którzy próbują siać niezgodę między Polakami a Ukraińcami poprzez manipulacje i dezinformację dotyczącą tragicznych wydarzeń na Wołyniu podczas II wojny światowej.

Jak wielu z Was wie, rzezie wołyńskie są bolesnym i drażliwym tematem zarówno dla Polaków, jak i Ukraińców. Pomimo upływu czasu, te wydarzenia wciąż budzą silne emocje i kontrowersje. Niestety, rosyjscy trolle wykorzystują te emocje, aby szerzyć niezgodę i podsycać nienawiść między naszymi narodami.

W ostatnich tygodniach zauważalny jest wzrost aktywności fałszywych kont, które zamieszczają prowokacyjne komentarze i memy mające na celu wywołanie negatywnych emocji i podziałów. Stosują różne techniki manipulacji, takie jak wyolbrzymianie zbrodni, minimalizowanie cierpienia jednej ze stron, a nawet fałszowanie faktów historycznych. Ważne jest, aby podkreślić, że ich celem nie jest tylko przypominanie nam o historycznych ranach, ale przede wszystkim podsycanie obecnych napięć politycznych i społecznych.

Dlatego zachęcam wszystkich do ostrożnego i krytycznego podejścia do informacji dostępnych w sieci. Sprawdzajmy źródła, analizujmy konteksty i, przede wszystkim, nie dajmy się wciągnąć w spiralę nienawiści.

Pobór to zło; jak więc dbać o obronność?,"Pobór jest szeroko krytykowany jako brutalny, okrutny i zniewalający jednostki. Tym bardziej, że armia poborowa to mięso armatnie. Żukowska jest tu wyklęta. Rozumiem to i uznaję. Też nie chcę umierać w okopie.

Ale potrzeba jest rzeczywista. Przykra prawda jest taka, że aby jedni mogli cieszyć się wolnością, inni muszą za tę wolność umierać. Nie będzie wolności w Polsce, jeśli będzie panował tu Putin, a Putin będzie tu panował, jeśli nie będzie wojska, które mu to uniemożliwi.

"Nawiązując do posta na subie. Czy ludzie nie zdają sobie sprawy, że wszystkie poglądy mają konsekwencje?","Znaczy spoko, każdy ma prawo do swoich poglądów, ale w momencie gdy twoje poglądy wpływają negatywnie na życie innych, to może tych poglądów nie miej?


Mieszkam na wsi, dość blisko małego miasta. Od znajomych, rodziny i ludzi w pracy słyszałem już wiele rzeczy. 


Znaczna część tego społeczeństwa nie żyje w tym samym świecie co ja i jak zgaduję większość tego suba. Rzeczy, które w tym roku już usłyszałem i zapamiętałem to m.in.:


- kobiety umierające w szpitalach (te na sepsę, gdy dochodzi do martwej ciąży) są same sobie winne że chciały aborcji - osoba to mówiąca (głosująca na ""jedyną słuszną partię w tym kraju"") uważa, że te śmierci są spowodowane wykonaniem aborcji a nie jej brakiem. Wina jest w decyzji kobiet a nie decyzji rządu czy lekarzy


- tyraniczna Unia Europejska zaraz wprowadzi w całej Polsce limit do 30km/h w każdym mieście - osoba to mówiąca zaczęła oglądać tiktoki o samochodach, co mogę więcej powiedzieć, wpadła w ""norę króliczą"" teorii spiskowych...


- ta sama osoba - w polskich szkołach dzieci uczą zmieniania płci, bycia gejami (dosłownie amerykańska teoria spiskowa o kulturowym marksiźmie, tylko w polskim wydaniu)


- ta sama osoba - Polska ma wprowadzić jakiś abonament za radio (nie wiem czy prawda czy nie, ale chodzi o coś jak abonament za telewizję, który ludzie niezbyt lubią płacić) - to jest uderzenie w kierowców, bo w samochodach są radia, oni specjalnie w kierowców uderzają


- ta sama osoba - Unia każe wprowadzać inne rodzaje paliw, jakies tam bardziej psujące silniki czy coś - uderzenie w kierowców, Polaków, żeby nas wykończyć doszczętnie


- osoby trans są chore psychicznie i się zabijają przez to (wcale nie przez bycie gnojonym przez społeczeństwo) 


- o gejach już nie wspomnę, bo wszyscy słyszeli jak się o nich mówi... (i o marszach równości zresztą też)


Teraz moje ulubione, od jednej osoby:

Czy ludzie nie zdają sobie sprawy, że wszystkie poglądy mają konsekwencje? Znaczy spoko, każdy ma prawo do swoich poglądów, ale w momencie gdy twoje poglądy wpływają negatywnie na życie innych, to może tych poglądów nie miej?


Mieszkam na wsi, dość blisko małego miasta. Od znajomych, rodziny i ludzi w pracy słyszałem już wiele rzeczy. 


Znaczna część tego społeczeństwa nie żyje w tym samym świecie co ja i jak zgaduję większość tego suba. Rzeczy, które w tym roku już usłyszałem i zapamiętałem to m.in.:


- kobiety umierające w szpitalach (te na sepsę, gdy dochodzi do martwej ciąży) są same sobie winne że chciały aborcji - osoba to mówiąca (głosująca na ""jedyną słuszną partię w tym kraju"") uważa, że te śmierci są spowodowane wykonaniem aborcji a nie jej brakiem. Wina jest w decyzji kobiet a nie decyzji rządu czy lekarzy


- tyraniczna Unia Europejska zaraz wprowadzi w całej Polsce limit do 30km/h w każdym mieście - osoba to mówiąca zaczęła oglądać tiktoki o samochodach, co mogę więcej powiedzieć, wpadła w ""norę króliczą"" teorii spiskowych...


- ta sama osoba - w polskich szkołach dzieci uczą zmieniania płci, bycia gejami (dosłownie amerykańska teoria spiskowa o kulturowym marksiźmie, tylko w polskim wydaniu)


- ta sama osoba - Polska ma wprowadzić jakiś abonament za radio (nie wiem czy prawda czy nie, ale chodzi o coś jak abonament za telewizję, który ludzie niezbyt lubią płacić) - to jest uderzenie w kierowców, bo w samochodach są radia, oni specjalnie w kierowców uderzają


- ta sama osoba - Unia każe wprowadzać inne rodzaje paliw, jakies tam bardziej psujące silniki czy coś - uderzenie w kierowców, Polaków, żeby nas wykończyć doszczętnie


- osoby trans są chore psychicznie i się zabijają przez to (wcale nie przez bycie gnojonym przez społeczeństwo) 


- o gejach już nie wspomnę, bo wszyscy słyszeli jak się o nich mówi... (i o marszach równości zresztą też)


Teraz moje ulubione, od jednej osoby:


- chemtrails, antyszczepionkowstwo (i tu nie chodzi o szczepionkę na covid), Ukraina, Niemcy (reparacje itp)


- globalne ocieplenie to spisek Ameryki, żeby nas oddzielić od wspaniałej Rosji, która chce dla nas jak najlepiej


- protesty w Iranie (Mahsa Amini) to tylko zachodnia propaganda i im sie tam wszystkim żyje wspaniale


- ogólnie wszystko to zachodnia propaganda (za wszystkim jest (((Wallstreet))), (((Hollywood))) i (((Soros)))

Ukraińska asystentka Tuska,"Wrzucam, bo to niezłe podsumowanie ""afery"", jaka od paru dni krąży gdzieniegdzie po sieci, a której autorem jest znany z tzw. ziemkiewiczowskiego riserczu Marcin Dobski. [Źródło poniższego tekstu](https://x.com/PutinizmPolski/status/1816742928603111658).

***

👉 Naprawdę, myślałem, że nie będę musiał się do tego zniżać, ale widzę, że pisowskie trolle są gotowe łyknąć dosłownie wszystko, co wydali z siebie Dobski i zaraz sprawa “kosmetolożki-agentki” będzie nowym dogmatem, jak te o WSI, Komoruskim, wyprzedaży lasów, Smoleńsku, uchodźcach, Berlinie i tak dalej i tak dalej.

👉 O co chodzi? Otóż pisowcy identyfikujący się jako dziennikarze odkryli, że Tusk ma asystentkę społeczną z Ukrainy. Jest nią 34 letnia Kristina Voronovska, która pracowała w salonie piękności. I przyznam się, że przez dłuższy czas myślałem, że to jest ta afera. Tusk ma asystentkę społeczną z Ukrainy, kobieta jest młoda, atrakcyjna, jest z branży beauty, co sugeruje brak kompetencji, na Instagramie ma “odważne zdjęcia”... przepraszam, ale może w tym miejscu wyjaśnię: ja teraz cytuję argumenty pisowców, ok? To były te argumenty. Że ładna, że ma selfiki, na których pokazuje nogi i tak dalej. Do tego dochodziła warstwa mająca grać na naszych najbardziej obrzydliwych emocjach, tzn. sugerowanie, że Kristina ma z Tuskiem jakiś romans, że “zdobyła stanowisko kręcąc tyłkiem” (to jedno z tych łagodniejszych określeń), że buja się z torebkami Louis Vuitton za “lekko licząc - ponad 10 tys. zł.” (to autor całej “afery” Marcin Dobski - ja znalazłem ten model torebki w sieci za 150-400 zł (zdjęcia poniżej), ale ok). A gdzieś mi mignęło, że ta torebka miała kosztować 25 tysięcy, co śmiało zrównano z tym “ile rocznie traci polski emeryt” - co chyba jasno pokazuje, jaki był prawdziwy cel tej operacji.

👉 Do tego dodajmy klasyczne po stronie pisowskiej propagowanie “szokujących ustaleń” za pomocą internetowych trolli. Najpierw więc Dobski i Nisztor, etatowi “dziennikarze” Partii, publikują “newsa”. Szczegóły historii natychmiast dopowiadają anonimowe konta typu John Bingham, które albo mają dostęp do informacji np. o rodzicach Kristiny, albo potrafią je w kilka minut znaleźć w internecie (zdecydujcie sami). A na koniec “oficjalne” pisowskie media, w których od lat pracują Dobski i Nisztor, publikują to z dopiskami typu “burza w sieci”, “niektórzy komentatorzy w sieci” (wPolityce), “wywołało burzę w mediach społecznościowych” (Gazeta Polska Codziennie), “rozgrzało do czerwoności media społecznośćiowe” (Do Rzeczy) i tak dalej, by sprawić wrażenie jakiejś masowości tej sprawy. Klasyczna zagrywka, której nie powstydziłaby się fabryka trolli w Petersburgu.

👉 Krótko mówiąc: myślałem, że to taki tam atak na tle, że tak powiem, obyczajowym. Sugestia,że premier zatrudnił niekompetentną młodą kobietę, płacąc jej hojnie, co z kolei sugeruje, że ma z nią romans. Żeby nie było: ta sugestia szła w tym przekazie bardzo otwarcie. Fakt, że kobieta jest Ukrainką, a nie na przykład Chorwatką, miał dobrze zarezonować w elektoracie z pogranicza PiS i Konfederosji, dlatego był tak namiętnie podkreślany.

👉 No ale żeby nie było niedomówień, to wyjaśnijmy: pani Kristina jest społeczną asystentką Tuska, co znaczy, że nie pobiera za to wynagrodzenia. Z namiętnie publikowanych przez prawicę zdjęć nie wynika, by prowadziła jakieś ekstrawaganckie żyćko. Nie widać tam też nic “odważnego” - są to zwykłe zdjęcia kobiety w tym wieku, która robi sobie selfiaki, czasem nieco skąpiej się ubierze, pokaże nogi i tak dalej. Jeśli kogoś to szokuje, to ten ktoś nie tylko nie załapał się na ostatnie 35 lat przemian obyczajowych w Polsce, ale chyba nawet na uniwersał połaniecki. Owszem, Kristina pracowała w salonie piękności, ale ma też magisterkę z ekonomii na ukraińskim uniwersytecie i przed przyjazdem do Polski pracowała w banku jako specjalistka. W Polsce nie mogła znaleźć pracy w branży, to poszła do innej - jak bardzo wielu imigrantów (także Polaków na Zachodzie). Choć asystentką Tuska została w maju, to w biurach KO pracowała na etacie już dwa lata temu i według polityków tej partii była ceniona za pracowitość.

👉 No i myślałem, że na tym koniec, ale okazało się, że te dzbany naprawdę chcą z niej zrobić rosyjską agentkę. Poniżej przedstawiam Wam niniejszym chyba wszystkie szokujące rewelacje. Kristina urodziła się w 1989 roku w Polsce, niedaleko radzieckiej bazy wojskowej. Ojciec Kristiny służył w radzieckiej armii. Kristina chodziła do szkoły w rosyjskiej Kalinowce. Kristina zmieniła nazwisko i ma siostrę o jeszcze innym nazwisku. Ta siostra ma na VKontakte kogoś o tym samym nazwisku, kto mieszka w Petersburgu i jest specjalistą od IT. Sama Kristina na VKontakte podaje dalej wpisy ludzi pochwalających putinowską agresję na Ukrainę.

👉 No to po kolei. Tak, jej ojciec był w radzieckiej armii, a po 1991 w ukraińskiej. Dokładnie tak samo jak 100% ukraińskich wojskowych, którzy służyli przed rokiem 1991 w jedynej armii, jaka była wtedy dostępna. Takich szokujących rewelacji można szukać więcej. Ja np. mam sąsiada, który pochodzi ze Stalinogrodu, bo tak w latach 1953-56 nazywały się Katowice. Kristina urodziła się w Polsce także dlatego, że jej dziadkowie byli Polakami, ale o tym już zapomnieli wspomnieć. Dodajmy, że “niedaleko radzieckiej bazy” urodziło się pewnie kilka milionów Polaków, bo radzieckich baz było dużo, a liczba szpitali była skończona. K

👉 Szkoła: tu jest pewna niejasność, bo po sieci lata screen, jakoby chodziła do szkoły nr 2 w Kalinowce w Rosji, ale pracująca z Kristiną radna PO z Warszawy mówi, że owszem, ale chodzi o szkołę nr 2 w Kalinowce… pod Winnicą. Winnica to takie miasto w Ukrainie. Ukraina to taki kraj niebędący częścią Rosji.

👉 Kristina zmieniła nazwisko, bo wzięła ślub i się rozwiodła. Jej siostra ma inne, bo jest siostrą cioteczną, a nie rodzoną. O tym czy ten typ o tym samym nazwisku to jej mąż/brat/kuzyn nie wiemy nic, może to być zbieżność. Z tego, że jest absolwentem państwowego uniwersytetu w Petersburgu (no bo niby jakiego innego?), też nic nie wynika. “Specjalista IT” to pojęcie szerokie. Czyli połączenie idzie tak: typ MOŻLIWE że jest podejrzany i ma to samo nazwisko co jakaś typiara, co MOŻLIWE, że nie jest przypadkowe, a wspomniana typiara to kuzynka Kristiny - ergo: Tusk zatrudnił ruską agentkę. A mówili, że to Piątek ma paranoję.

👉 Dalej: Kristina podała na VKontakte wpis typa pochwalającego rosyjską agresję. Tak. Podała go dalej w 2014 roku. Typ poparł agresję w 2022, nawet sobie zmienił proflowe na Z-tkę.
Kolejne dowody to… nie, czekaj, to koniec. To jest to.

👉 Od siebie dodam coś istotnego. Otóż tak się składa, że musiałem dziesiątki, jak nie setki, razy przeglądać social media różnych podejrzanych osób. Przescrollowałem dosłownie dziesiątki tysięcy postów. I chciałbym uprzejmie donieść, że jeśli ktoś rozsiewa rosyjską propagandę, ma jakieś dziwne powiązania i tak dalej - to naprawdę widać dość jednoznacznie. Tymczasem tutaj Dobski z Nisztorem musieli cofnąć się na profilu Kristiny aż do roku 2014 i max co znaleźli to udostępnienie posta jednego gościa, który osiem lat później okazał się popierać inwazję, jak większość Rosjan zresztą. No więc samo to jest de facto dowodem na to, że tej afery nie ma. Gdyby Kristina miała propagować ruską propagandę albo coś takiego, gwarantuję, że na jej profilach znaleźlibyśmy multum postów, co do których nikt nie miałby wątpliwości.

👉 Oczywiście fakt, że cała ta historia to tanie granie na emocjach, podparte półprawdami, manipulacjami (siostra, a siostra cioteczna, złamanie chronologii w udostępnianiu itd.), nie przeszkodziło pisowcom budować narracji, że oto mamy do czynienia z wielką aferą, która wymaga natychmiastowej reakcji ABW. Jednocześnie szybko zbudowano spin, że wszystkie te opowieści o Macierewiczu czy innych Kownackich to pikuś w porównaniu z Potenżną Aferą Kristiny. Tu może dodam, że Macierewicz bez uprawnień wpuszczał na teren SKW Rosjankę pracującą dla kontrolowanego przez ruskie służby Intouristu, a to nie jest nawet TOP 5 najdziwniejszych rzeczy, które zrobił.

👉 “Idzie olbrzym” - zapowiadał odpalenie afery Dobski. I miał rację. Był to olbrzymi stek kłamstw i dezinformacji, przez które zaszczuto niewinną kobietę.

Przyszłość relacji polsko-ukraińskich,"Cześć wszystkim. Zdecydowałem się napisać, ponieważ ostatnio czuję się trochę zdesperowany z powodu wszystkich napięć między Ukraińcami a Polakami.

Nie jestem dobry w pisaniu po polsku, ale dobrze go rozumiem i mam nadzieję, że nie ma tu zbyt wielu błędów, ponieważ dużo pomogli mi Google Translator i GPT.

Od 24.02.2022 moja rodzina i ja mieszkamy w Polsce. Uciekliśmy przed wojną pierwszego dnia i z jakiegoś powodu mnie wypuścili, może dlatego, że wszystko było takie chaotyczne. Wiem, że wielu ludzi po prostu nazwie to tchórzostwem i powie, że powinienem wrócić i walczyć, ale po prostu nie mogę. Jestem zbyt przestraszony, żeby to zrobić. Będzie mnie to prześladować przez resztę życia.

Kocham Polskę, ponieważ naprawdę stała się drugim domem dla mojej rodziny. Moja żona i ja mamy małe dziecko i nie mogę wam powiedzieć, ile miałem koszmarów, i nadal mam, kiedy słyszę, co dzieje się z dziećmi na Ukrainie. Ostatnia historia o kobiecie, która została spalona żywcem z dzieckiem na rękach w Charkowie z powodu ataku rosyjskiej rakiety, to coś, czego ostatnio nie mogę wyrzucić z głowy.

Przede wszystkim chcę podziękować Polsce jako krajowi i Polakom jako narodowi za pomoc, która była i jest nadal udzielana Ukrainie. To naprawdę dużo. Mieliśmy i nadal mamy wiele różnic w naszej historii i obecnych relacjach, ale wszyscy zrobiliście tak wiele. Nie da się opisać, jak wiele to znaczy i ile życiów dotknęła ta pomoc.

Po drugie, chcę powiedzieć, że jestem wdzięczny za bezpieczeństwo mojej rodziny. Nie potrafię opisać uczucia, kiedy po prostu wiesz, że teraz istnieje to nowe, zawsze czyhające zagrożenie dla twojego życia. Byłem ""szczęśliwy"", że poczułem to tylko przez chwilę, ale nadal pamiętam to tak, jakby to było dzisiaj. Wielu moich przyjaciół przeżywa to każdego dnia. Teraz większość z nich po prostu mówi, że wszystko jest w porządku... ale od czasu do czasu coś w nich pęka i po prostu załamują się na kilka dni. To ciągła presja, której nie da się opisać, i chociaż wstydzę się to przyznać, tak, jestem wdzięczny za nasze bezpieczeństwo, kiedy tak wielu ludzi nie jest bezpiecznych.

Po trzecie, jestem wdzięczny za pomoc zwykłych Polaków, którzy w pierwszych dniach wojny pomogli tak wielu ludziom w desperacji. Czasami zastanawiam się, czy my pomoglibyśmy aż tak bardzo? Po prostu nie wiem. Byliśmy ""szczęśliwymi"" uchodźcami; moja ciocia pracowała w Polsce i mieliśmy miejsce na kilka dni, co pomogło nam znaleźć miejsce do wynajęcia. Nasi gospodarze pozwolili nam mieszkać za darmo przez 1 miesiąc, chociaż nie przyszliśmy z pustymi kieszeniami; po prostu nie wzięli za ten pierwszy miesiąc pieniędzy.

Po czwarte, jestem wdzięczny za możliwość legalnej pracy. Pracuję na umowie B2B z amerykańską firmą, więc to nie tak, że Polska dała mi pracę, ale dała mi prawo do legalnej pracy, aby utrzymać moją rodzinę, i jestem za to wdzięczny.

Mając to wszystko na uwadze, ostatnie 6-8 miesięcy było naprawdę trudne dla relacji między Ukrainą a Polską, jak również między Polakami a Ukraińcami. Znam powody. Rozumiem waszą frustrację związaną z ludźmi, którzy nie są wdzięczni. Rozumiem, że ukraińska polityka może być problematyczna przez większość czasu. Wiem, że źle się czujecie z powodu waszych rolników. Ale... dlaczego teraz wszystko jest TAK źle? W ostatnich miesiącach czuję, że nie możemy zrobić nic dobrego... za każdym razem, gdy wchodzę do Internetu, widzę mnóstwo komentarzy o tym, jak jesteśmy niewdzięczni, jak jesteśmy okropni, jak nasz kraj jest skorumpowany (czego nie mogę zaprzeczyć, to wstyd), że nie można z nami rozsądnie rozmawiać itd. Wiem, że jest ogromna ilość trolli, a media zawsze interesują się złymi wiadomościami, ale na pewno wpłynęło to na wielu rzeczywistych ludzi.

Istnieje kilka głównych tematów, które są często poruszane w kontekście zmęczenia Ukrainą i Ukraińcami, takie jak:

ZbożeGłupota naszego rząduZabezpieczenie społeczneNiegrzeczność ludziJeśli spojrzysz na tę listę pobieżnie, nie wygląda to źle, prawda? Ale te tematy są bardzo skomplikowane.

Nasze produkty są po prostu tańsze, ponieważ nie podlegają tym samym przepisom. Czy to sprawiedliwe? Cóż, nie sądzę, i wydaje się, że lepiej byłoby, aby te zasady były bardziej rygorystyczne, aby zapewnić, że zboże jest tylko tranzytowane lub kupowane w ścisłych limitach. Mimo to, dla mnie to dziwna sytuacja, ponieważ ludzie sugerują, że to 99% Ukraina jest w tej sytuacji w błędzie. Proszę zrozumieć, ludzie zawsze będą wspierać swoich rolników. Ale posłuchajcie, Ukraina nie może sobie pozwolić, aby nie sprzedawać wszystkiego, co może; każda złotówka się liczy. Ludzie mówią, że ukraińscy rolnicy w ogóle nie są rolnikami, tylko oligarchami, i częściowo jest to prawda. Niektórzy z nich to oligarchowie, niektórzy to koncerny UE, a prawie 50% z nich to klasyczni rolnicy. Ale bez względu na to, kto jest właścicielem ziemi, to rolnicy pracują na tej ziemi. Prawie całe obwody Zaporoża i Chersoń są okupowane, pomimo powszechnej opinii, że południe jest bardzo przemysłowe; poza miastami jest SUPER rolnicze. Dodajcie 50-100 km od frontu, aby zrozumieć, jak bezpiecznie jest być rolnikiem na Ukrainie; to nie przepisy zabijają nasze rolnictwo, to wojna. Ukraina nadal wypełnia swoje kontrakty z Afryką, pomimo utraty terytorium, i sprzedaje część produktów w UE. Czy może być ich za dużo? Absolutnie. Czy Ukraina może sobie pozwolić na niesprzedaż, jeśli w ogóle jest kupowana? W żadnym wypadku. Nikt nie prosi nikogo, aby zapomniał o interesach swoich rodaków; byłaby to hipokryzja, ale jest część tej sytuacji, która nie jest wystarczająco podkreślona. Ukraina teraz kupuje od Polski kilka razy więcej produktów rolnych niż przed wojną, tworząc wiele nowych miejsc pracy w portach. Możemy znaleźć wspólny język; możecie zaostrzyć przepisy, to wasze prawo, ale nie możecie prosić Ukrainy, aby kontrolowała kupujących na terytorium UE; nie możemy sobie pozwolić na niesprzedaż w ogóle.

Głupota naszego rządu. Nie mogę bronić działań naszego rządu, ponieważ były liczne przypadki, które zawstydziłyby mnie, nawet gdyby mój wujek napisał je anonimowo w internecie. Naprawdę mi przykro.

Zabezpieczenie społeczne to kolejny istotny temat. Przede wszystkim każda pomoc jest bezcenna i przepraszam, jeśli są Ukraińcy, którzy nie okazali wdzięczności za tę pomoc. Udzielono znacznej pomocy, ale główne media i media społecznościowe rozpowszechniły pogląd, że Ukraińcy to po prostu pijawki żyjące z zasiłków socjalnych. Wsparcie na dzieci, w szczególności, było i jest ratunkiem dla samotnych matek, które nie mogły od razu pracować po ucieczce. Chociaż część tego wsparcia była finansowana z pieniędzy UE, większa część pochodziła z polskich podatków, co stanowi pomoc, której nie wszyscy mogli chcieć udzielić, ale mimo to udzielili. Ostatnie raporty z ostatnich dwóch lat pokazują, że prawie wszyscy uchodźcy w wieku produkcyjnym są zatrudnieni. Jeśli wykluczymy dzieci, osoby starsze i niepełnosprawne z całkowitej liczby, 67% wskaźnik zatrudnienia wśród pozostałych uchodźców pokazuje, że nie próbujemy nikogo wykorzystywać. Co więcej, w zeszłym tygodniu w polskim parlamencie jeden z ministrów przedstawił statystyki pokazujące, że wśród wszystkich krajów przyjmujących uchodźców Polska ma najwyższy odsetek zatrudnionych wśród nich. W odniesieniu do innych programów, takich jak darmowe zakwaterowanie czy początkowe 120 dni wsparcia 40+, zrozumiałe jest, że takie inicjatywy nie mogą być utrzymywane w nieskończoność i nie są dostępne wszędzie. Istnieją dyskusje na temat możliwości wycofania dodatkowego wsparcia finansowego dla pracujących uchodźców, którzy nie są obywatelami Polski i nie mają czasowego lub stalego pobytu. Byłby to znaczący krok wstecz, ponieważ te środki, choć niewystarczające do życia, stanowią znaczącą pomoc dla tych, którzy sami opiekują się swoimi dziećmi. Te programy powinny rzeczywiście zostać zrewidowane, aby zapobiec nadużyciom, ale pogląd, że wszyscy Ukraińcy to pijawki, jest nieuzasadniony. To inna sytuacja dla tych, którzy uciekli przed wojną; nie wybrali migracji z przyczyn ekonomicznych, ale zostali zmuszeni do opuszczenia swojego życia w jednej chwili. Jest dobrze znane, że nie można przeżyć tylko z zasiłków na dzieci, a te są wypłacane tylko na dzieci. Chociaż nie jest to często dyskutowane, istnieją artykuły podkreślające, jak bardzo ukraińscy uchodźcy pracują i przyczyniają się do podatków. Chcemy być częścią społeczności, ale pytanie o niemożność uzyskania karty pobytu w niektórych miejscach przez 2-3 lata oraz niemożliwość zarejestrowania swoich dzieci lub osób, które nie mogą pracować do swojej kartu pobytu, aby mogły legalnie tu przebywać, jest bolesną kwestią.

Jeśli chodzi o niegrzeczność, jest to rzeczywiście znaczący problem. Niektórzy z naszych ludzi przyjęli mentalność, w której bycie asertywnym i nieustępliwym jest jedynym sposobem, aby być słyszanym, mentalność głęboko zakorzenioną jeszcze z czasów sowieckich. Zmiana takich zachowań jest dla niektórych trudniejsza niż dla innych, ale niegrzeczność nie jest wyłączna dla Ukraińców; istnieje we wszystkich społeczeństwach. Niegrzeczni ludzie wyróżniają się, ponieważ ich działania mają większy wpływ niż działania uprzejmych ludzi, pozostawiając trwałe wrażenie. Spotkałem niegrzecznych Polaków, którzy byli lekceważący wobec Ukraińców, ale nie sądzę, aby reprezentowali całą populację. Podobnie, negatywne komentarze, które widziałem, nie odzwierciedlają postaw wszystkich Polaków wobec Ukraińców.

Podsumowując, ten post nie ma na celu zmienić czyjegoś zdania, być obraźliwym ani nikogo obrażać. Po prostu chcę zrozumieć wasze myśli i uczucia. Czy możemy współistnieć i znaleźć kompromisy, czy sądzicie, że sytuacja tylko się pogorszy?  


edit: data.",Polska,2024-02-12 21:50:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/1apc4ez/przyszłość_relacji_polskoukraińskich/,"Przyszłość relacji polsko-ukraińskich Cześć wszystkim. Zdecydowałem się napisać, ponieważ ostatnio czuję się trochę zdesperowany z powodu wszystkich napięć między Ukraińcami a Polakami.

Nie jestem dobry w pisaniu po polsku, ale dobrze go rozumiem i mam nadzieję, że nie ma tu zbyt wielu błędów, ponieważ dużo pomogli mi Google Translator i GPT.

Od 24.02.2022 moja rodzina i ja mieszkamy w Polsce. Uciekliśmy przed wojną pierwszego dnia i z jakiegoś powodu mnie wypuścili, może dlatego, że wszystko było takie chaotyczne. Wiem, że wielu ludzi po prostu nazwie to tchórzostwem i powie, że powinienem wrócić i walczyć, ale po prostu nie mogę. Jestem zbyt przestraszony, żeby to zrobić. Będzie mnie to prześladować przez resztę życia.

Kocham Polskę, ponieważ naprawdę stała się drugim domem dla mojej rodziny. Moja żona i ja mamy małe dziecko i nie mogę wam powiedzieć, ile miałem koszmarów, i nadal mam, kiedy słyszę, co dzieje się z dziećmi na Ukrainie. Ostatnia historia o kobiecie, która została spalona żywcem z dzieckiem na rękach w Charkowie z powodu ataku rosyjskiej rakiety, to coś, czego ostatnio nie mogę wyrzucić z głowy.

Przede wszystkim chcę podziękować Polsce jako krajowi i Polakom jako narodowi za pomoc, która była i jest nadal udzielana Ukrainie. To naprawdę dużo. Mieliśmy i nadal mamy wiele różnic w naszej historii i obecnych relacjach, ale wszyscy zrobiliście tak wiele. Nie da się opisać, jak wiele to znaczy i ile życiów dotknęła ta pomoc.

Po drugie, chcę powiedzieć, że jestem wdzięczny za bezpieczeństwo mojej rodziny. Nie potrafię opisać uczucia, kiedy po prostu wiesz, że teraz istnieje to nowe, zawsze czyhające zagrożenie dla twojego życia. Byłem ""szczęśliwy"", że poczułem to tylko przez chwilę, ale nadal pamiętam to tak, jakby to było dzisiaj. Wielu moich przyjaciół przeżywa to każdego dnia. Teraz większość z nich po prostu mówi, że wszystko jest w porządku... ale od czasu do czasu coś w nich pęka i po prostu załamują się na kilka dni. To ciągła presja, której nie da się opisać, i chociaż wstydzę się to przyznać, tak, jestem wdzięczny za nasze bezpieczeństwo, kiedy tak wielu ludzi nie jest bezpiecznych.

Po trzecie, jestem wdzięczny za pomoc zwykłych Polaków, którzy w pierwszych dniach wojny pomogli tak wielu ludziom w desperacji. Czasami zastanawiam się, czy my pomoglibyśmy aż tak bardzo? Po prostu nie wiem. Byliśmy ""szczęśliwymi"" uchodźcami; moja ciocia pracowała w Polsce i mieliśmy miejsce na kilka dni, co pomogło nam znaleźć miejsce do wynajęcia. Nasi gospodarze pozwolili nam mieszkać za darmo przez 1 miesiąc, chociaż nie przyszliśmy z pustymi kieszeniami; po prostu nie wzięli za ten pierwszy miesiąc pieniędzy.

Po czwarte, jestem wdzięczny za możliwość legalnej pracy. Pracuję na umowie B2B z amerykańską firmą, więc to nie tak, że Polska dała mi pracę, ale dała mi prawo do legalnej pracy, aby utrzymać moją rodzinę, i jestem za to wdzięczny.

Mając to wszystko na uwadze, ostatnie 6-8 miesięcy było naprawdę trudne dla relacji między Ukrainą a Polską, jak również między Polakami a Ukraińcami. Znam powody. Rozumiem waszą frustrację związaną z ludźmi, którzy nie są wdzięczni. Rozumiem, że ukraińska polityka może być problematyczna przez większość czasu. Wiem, że źle się czujecie z powodu waszych rolników. Ale... dlaczego teraz wszystko jest TAK źle? W ostatnich miesiącach czuję, że nie możemy zrobić nic dobrego... za każdym razem, gdy wchodzę do Internetu, widzę mnóstwo komentarzy o tym, jak jesteśmy niewdzięczni, jak jesteśmy okropni, jak nasz kraj jest skorumpowany (czego nie mogę zaprzeczyć, to wstyd), że nie można z nami rozsądnie rozmawiać itd.

"Czego nie mówi PiS, czyli liberalna polityka migracyjna polskiego rządu","Cześć r/Polska,

w ostatnim czasie dużo się mówi w Polsce (i na r/Polska) o migracji do Polski, głównie w kontekście propozycji UE, referendum itd. Osobiście uważam, że aktualna narracja jest mocno skrzywiona względem rzeczywistości aka danych migracyjnych i polityki jaką prowadzi PiS - spoiler: jest to bardzo liberalna polityka.

Post ten ma charakter edukacyjny. Piszę go ze względu na lukę w świadomości, jaka panuje w naszym społeczeństwie - media praktycznie nie podejmują tego tematu. Mamy artykuły o migracji z Ukrainy (głównie po 2014 roku) oraz uchodźcach (od 2015 roku), ale o migracji ekonomicznej spoza UE (wyłączając Ukrainę i Białoruś) musiałam się długo naszukać.

Sama zaczęłam zauważać po pandemii więcej osób spoza Europy wokół mnie (mieszkam w Krakowie) - studenci z Azji na kampusie, dostawca jedzenia z Afryki... Moje przypuszczenia okazały się prawdziwe, gdy w Raporcie o stanie świata usłyszałam od eksperta ds. migracji z UW, że Polska prowadzi  najbardziej otwartą politykę migracji ekonomicznej na świecie. Ale jak to? Przecież PiS miał bronić Wielkiej Białej Polski. Otóż PiS robi medialną nagonkę opartą na antyimigranckim sentymencie, jednocześnie wydając rekordowe liczby zezwoleń na pobyt.

Polityka migracyjna w pigułce (na podstawie kilku artykułów, skupiłam głównie na migracji ekonomicznej):

\- Konkurencyjność polskiej gospodarki opiera się na taniej sile roboczej. Ograniczenie migracji mężczyzn z Ukrainy po lutym 2022 powodem do kolejnej liberalizacji prawa migracyjnego (Raport o stanie świata).

\- Cudzoziemcy mają ""możliwość uzyskania krótkoterminowej wizy umożliwiającej pracę na podstawie tzw. oświadczenia o zamiarze zatrudnienia cudzoziemca, które pracodawcy mogą wystawiać obywatelom sześciu krajów byłego ZSRR (Armenii, Białorusi, Gruzji, Mołdawii, Rosji i Ukrainy)"" ([oko.press](https://oko.press)).

\- ""Liczby zarejestrowanych oświadczeń rosły lawinowo: ze 180 tys. w 2010 roku do 1,6 mln w 2019... Maksymalna długość pracy na podstawie takiego dokumentu wynosiła początkowo 3, potem 6 z 12 miesięcy w roku. W styczniu 2022 weszły w życie nowe przepisy, wydłużające ten czas do 24 miesięcy, po których pracodawca może natychmiast złożyć nowe oświadczenie"" ([oko.press](https://oko.press)).

\- ""w 2018 roku po raz pierwszy bilans migracyjny był dodatni dla Polski. **Polska stała się więc krajem imigracji**"" ([oko.press](https://oko.press)).

\- ""W ubiegłym roku wśród 15,2 mln pracujących w Polsce 3,8 proc. stanowili cudzoziemcy."" (pulshr.pl), czyli 577,6 tys, osób.

\- Niedobory ukraińskich mężczyzn na rynku pracy łatają głównie migranci z Azji Środkowej. ""W danych podsumowujących 2022 r. widoczny jest ogólny spadek liczby pozwoleń na pracę dla cudzoziemców, co jest bezpośrednią konsekwencją wojny. Zaobserwować można również wzrost liczby zezwoleń dla obywateli innych krajów niż Ukraina, po których zaczęli sięgać pracodawcy mierzący się z deficytem kadrowym... Ogólnie w 2022 r. wydano 365 tys. zezwoleń na podjęcie zatrudnienia przez cudzoziemców, z czego 85 tys. dla Ukraińców. W 2021 r. było to 504 tys., z czego Ukraińcy otrzymali aż 325 tys. To pokazuje wyraźnie, że miejsce obywateli Ukrainy zajmują inne narodowości.

Reszta przypadła na obywateli innych krajów, z czego największą ich liczbę otrzymali mieszkańcy: Indii (41,6 tys.), Uzbekistanu (33,3 tys.), Turcji (25 tys.), Filipin (22,5 tys.), Nepalu (20 tys.), Białorusi (18,4 tys.)."" (strefabiznesu.pl)

\- ""Łącznie z dotychczasową populacją migrantów w Polsce – wynoszącą według OECD 0,8 mln osób w 2020 roku – **liczba obcokrajowców mieszkających w naszym kraju może wynosić ok. 2,2 miliony**"". ([300gospodarka.pl](https://300gospodarka.pl))

\- Polski rząd nie prowadzi jednej, spójnej polityki migracyjnej. Ostani dokument rząd zaakceptował w 2012 roku, ale w 2015, po zmianie rządzącej koalicji, wycofał go. Wszystkie aktualne polityki opierają się na decyzjach pojedynczych instytucji (np. Straży Granicznej). ""Oznacza to w praktyce, że w Polsce nie zostały stworzone mechanizmy wsparcia procesu włączania imigrantów do instytucji państwa przyjmującego"".  (Gościnna Polska 2022+, s. 18).

To chyba najważniejsze informacje w tym temacie. Nie jestem w żaden sposób ekspertką z zakresu migracji, statystyki, analizy danych itd. Nie pisałam też oczywistości typu ""większość migrantów to Ukraińcy"", a jedynie wyłuskałam najważniejsze (z mojego punktu widzenia) informacje. Załączam też wszystkie źródła, z których możecie się dowiedzieć jeszcze więcej, wyciągnąć własne wnioski itd.

Reszta przypadła na obywateli innych krajów, z czego największą ich liczbę otrzymali mieszkańcy: Indii (41,6 tys.), Uzbekistanu (33,3 tys.), Turcji (25 tys.), Filipin (22,5 tys.), Nepalu (20 tys.), Białorusi (18,4 tys.)."" (strefabiznesu.pl)

\- ""Łącznie z dotychczasową populacją migrantów w Polsce – wynoszącą według OECD 0,8 mln osób w 2020 roku – **liczba obcokrajowców mieszkających w naszym kraju może wynosić ok. 2,2 miliony**"". ([300gospodarka.pl](https://300gospodarka.pl))

\- Polski rząd nie prowadzi jednej, spójnej polityki migracyjnej. Ostani dokument rząd zaakceptował w 2012 roku, ale w 2015, po zmianie rządzącej koalicji, wycofał go. Wszystkie aktualne polityki opierają się na decyzjach pojedynczych instytucji (np. Straży Granicznej). ""Oznacza to w praktyce, że w Polsce nie zostały stworzone mechanizmy wsparcia procesu włączania imigrantów do instytucji państwa przyjmującego"".  (Gościnna Polska 2022+, s. 18).

To chyba najważniejsze informacje w tym temacie. Nie jestem w żaden sposób ekspertką z zakresu migracji, statystyki, analizy danych itd. Nie pisałam też oczywistości typu ""większość migrantów to Ukraińcy"", a jedynie wyłuskałam najważniejsze (z mojego punktu widzenia) informacje. Załączam też wszystkie źródła, z których możecie się dowiedzieć jeszcze więcej, wyciągnąć własne wnioski itd.

Sytuacja po wojnie w Ukrainie,"Myśle, że każdy złapał sie na przemysleniach w tym temacie chociaż raz. Oczywiście nigdy przenigdy w życiu nie chciałbym aby rosja zwyciężyła w tym konflikcie, lecz osobiście, pomimo tego jak została ona w trakcie (zwlaszcza na początku) upokorzona, rosja prawdopodobnie posiada w swoim arsenale tyle mięsa armatniego, że mogliby sie napierdalać nastepne 10 lat lekką ręką.

**PIKIETA 26 MARCA GODZ. 14 PRZED WARSZAWSKIM SKLEPEM LEROY MERLIN, MALBORSKA 35**

**LEROY-KREMLIN IDI NACHUJ**

Kochani,

15 marca urządziliśmy małą pikietę przed warszawskim sklepem Leroy Merlin w centrum handlowym Arkadia. Powód protestu był prosty – firmy należące do grupy AFM (Mulliez) nadal nie wycofały się z rosyjskiego rynku, a nawet jak informują reżimowe media planują ekspansję korzystając z tego, że powstała luka na rynku. 

Obsługa sklepu była wyraźnie zmieszana naszym protestem, poprosili nas o opuszczenie terenu i wezwali policję. Funkcjonariusze podpierając się regulaminem galerii handlowej poinformowali nas, że narażamy się na zarzut zakłócenia miru domowego i poprosili o przeniesienie protestu poza teren galerii.

Reakcje klientów były różnorodne. Jedna pani zapytała – a czy zamierzacie protestować pod  Castoramą? Jakiś pan stwierdził – no i co, że robią interesy w Rosji? Business is businness. Ktoś inny zapytał – a dlaczego odmawiać zwykłym Rosjanom zakupów w sklepie Leroy? A gdyby ktoś nam chciał zabrać sklepy meblowe, bo mamy Kaczyńskiego? Inne osoby mówiły np. znam temat i zgadzam się. Chyba najfajniejsza reakcja była taka – nie wiedziałam o tym, już nie będę kupować w tym sklepie, albo - szkoda, że nie wiedziałem wcześniej, poszedłbym gdzie indziej. 

Nasz protest był, nie ukrywam, dość amatorski. Uczestniczyło w nim słownie 4 osoby. Jednak spowodował zgromadzenie większości pracowników ochrony sklepu, części obsługi i pewne zamieszanie, które trwało około godziny. Rozdaliśmy 400 ulotek i chodziliśmy z plakatami nawołującymi do bojkotu sklepu zgodnie z hasłem „Leroy-Kremlin idi nachuj”. Można to chyba uznać za sukces biorąc pod uwagę zaangażowane skromne środki. 

Dlatego postanowiliśmy powtórzyć to wydarzenie. Skoro pretekstem do usunięcia demonstrantów jest wejście na teren sklepu, tym razem może spotkajmy się przed wejściem do dużego sklepu Leroy Merlin na Malborskiej w Warszawie. Protest odbędzie się sobotę 26 marca o godzinie 14. Ze swojej strony postaram się zapewnić około tysiąca ulotek, kilka zalaminowanych plakatów anty-Leroy. Postaram się o muzykę na temat „Bayraktarr song”, „Putin” by Cypis itp. Chciałbym namówić wszystkie osoby, które zgadzają się i z ideą protestu do przyłączenia się. Poniżej przykład ulotki – drukowaliśmy ją w formacie A5 na zielonym papierze. Bardzo proszę o powielanie. W sieci znajduje się już sporo memów, obrazków związanych z akcją skierowaną przeciwko sklepom grupy Mulliez (Auchan, Leroy-Merlin, Decathlon). Można coś wydrukować i przynieść ze sobą. 

Gdyby ktoś chciał zorganizować podobną akcję w innym mieście, w innych sklepach Leroy, Auchan albo Decathlon byłoby jeszcze lepiej. 

A teraz najważniejsze pytanie – jaki to ma sens? W moim przekonaniu mamy niewielki wpływ na to co Rosja wyprawia na Ukrainie. Jeszcze mniejszy na działalność zachodnich biznesów w Rosji. Nie jesteśmy jednak zupełnie bezsilni jeśli chodzi o działalność korporacji działających w Polsce. Akcja obywatelskiego bojkotu, gdyby osiągnęła pewien rozpęd i doprowadziła do szkód wizerunkowych lub spadków obrotu sklepów może dać do myślenia menadżerom w centrali firmy Mulliez.

Kolejne pytanie – dlaczego brać na cel akurat francuskie sklepy, dlaczego nie inne? Może dlatego, że rosyjska filia Auchan, Leroy i Decathlonu w sposób wyjątkowo jaskrawy wyłamała się z zachodniej akcji bojkotu rosyjskiego rynku zgodnie z zasadą „pieniądze nie śmierdzą”. Faktem jest, że mają dużo do stracenia – Auchan w Rosji to prawdziwa potęga. Prezydent Macron jak podaje „Le Figaro” miał spotkać się z liderami francuskiego biznesu i namawiać do „powstrzymania się od pochopnych decyzji” dotyczących opuszczania rosyjskiego rynku. Nie oznacza to jednak, że te wszystkie działanie można usprawiedliwić. Lenin ponoć powiedział kiedyś „Kapitaliści sprzedadzą nam sznurek, na którym ich powiesimy”. To powiedzenie wyjątkowo pasuje do obecnego zachowania francuskich biznesmenów. Putin nie jest przecież przyjacielem Zachodu – dąży do odtworzenia sowieckiego imperium. Francuzi najwyraźniej wychodzą z założenia, że są bezpieczni. Od toczącej się wojny dzielą ich przecież aż dwa kraje. Do tej pory prorosyjską postawę Francji można było tłumaczyć chęcią swoistego resetu po rozpadzie Związku Radzieckiego. Prowadzenie biznesów z Putinem można było interpretować jako chęć przeciągnięcia Rosjan na stronę Zachodu. Ta koncepcja jednak zbankrutowała 24 marca kiedy Rosja zaatakowała niezależne państwo i zaczęła systematyczną masakrę cywilnej ludności. Wpisuje się to jednocześnie w ogólny stosunek Francuzów do Europy wschodniej. To przecież były francuski prezydent Giscard d’Estaing promował ideę Europy dwóch prędkości wpisując między innymi Polskę w obóz krajów gorszych. Francja była i pozostaje najwyraźniej zwolennikiem poglądu, że istnieje coś takiego jak rosyjska strefa wpływu w Europie. Wystarczy spojrzeć na obecną sytuację polityczną. Wg najnowszych sondaży w wyścigu prezydenckim liczą się obecnie Macron, Le Pen, Zemmour, Melenchon i Pecresse. Partia Marine Le Pen była finansowana przez Kreml i niejednokrotnie wspierała Putina. Odwiedziła go zresztą na Kremlu 24 marca, trudno o bardziej symboliczną zbieżność. Melenchon, Lider Niepokornej Francji to skrajna prorosyjska Lewica. Jest zwolennikiem wyjścia Francji z Nato, marzył o „francuskim Putinie”. Zemmour teoretycznie wyraża solidarność z Ukrainą, ale zaraz potem dodaje że rosyjska agresja jest wynikiem polityki Unii i NATO, które lekceważyły „zasadne zastrzeżenia Rosji w kwestii bezpieczeństwa”. Jedyną kandydatką w tych wyborach, która deklaruje twardy kurs wobec Rosji jest Valerie Pecress. Francuska prasa jednak oskarża ją o hipokryzję. Jej bliski współpracownik, były premier, Francois Fillon zasiadł niedawno w zarządzie rosyjskiej firmy petrochemicznej Sibur, w której jednym z głównych udziałowców jest Giennadij Ticzenko, bliski znajomy Putina. W czerwcu Fillon zasiadł w radzie innej firmy petrochemiczne Zarubezneft. W tym towarzystwie Emmanuel Macron wydaje się chyba najbardziej wyważony, co tylko pokazuje jak mocno Francja wpadła w orbitę rosyjskich wpływów.  

Na koniec ważna uwaga – bojkot sklepów należących do koncernu Mulliez nie jest wymierzony w polskich pracowników. Chyba przeważająca większość z nich solidaryzuje się z cierpieniem ofiar wojny na Ukrainie. Są przykłady tego, że polskie szefostwo sklepów grupy AFM nawet czynnie wspierało różne akcje pomocowe związane z wojną. Potrzebna jest jednak presja nas wszystkich aby francuska centrala poszła po rozum do głowy. Może da im do myślenia fakt, że współpracując z wrogiem koncern niszczy sobie reputację w cywilizowanej Europie. Myślę, że pracownicy sklepów grupy Mulliez mogliby w jakiś sposób zamanifestować swoje zdanie na ten temat. Może przydałaby się jakaś akcja solidarnościowa. Na przykład przyjście do pracy 24 marca w miesięcznicę inwazji rosyjskiej na Ukrainę w niebiesko-żółtych opaskach. Nie wiem, tak się tylko zastanawiam…

Auchan, Leroy Merlin i Decathlon należą do francuskiej rodziny Gerarda Mullieza. Trzy marki działają już w Polsce od lat i zdążyły sobie wypracować mocną pozycję na rynku. Gdy wybuchła wojna na Ukrainie wiele prywatnych firm zdecydowała się wycofać z rosyjskiego rynku, ale na ten ruch nie zdecydowały się wyżej wymienione sieci. Firmy rodziny Mulliez zostają w Rosji. Wśród nich Auchan, Leroy Merlin i Decathlon. Rosyjskie źródło RIA Novosti poinformowało, że Leroy Merlin po odejściu konkurencji z wschodniego rynku jest **""otwarte na zwiększenie dostaw i asortymentu"".** Również rosyjska agencja Tass potwierdziła pozostanie firmy na wschodnim rynku. Z kolei Auchan jeszcze w listopadzie 2021 roku podpisał umowę z gigantem e-commerce Sbermarket, który skoncentruje się na dostawach dark stores. W Rosji pozostał także Decathlon.

Sieć Leroy Merlin Polska poinformowała, że nie ma wpływu na działania centrali i przynajmniej pomaga ofiarom wojny. To naprawdę miło ze strony polskiej filii, ale to jest daleko niewystarczające biorąc pod uwagę fakt, że Rosjanie strzelają z czołgów do bloków mieszkalnych i bombardują szpitale położnicze. Dlatego wzywamy do bojkotu sklepów sieci AFM pod hasłem Leroy-Putin idi na chuj!

**BOJKOT SKLEPÓW GRUPY AFM LEROY-MERLIN, AUCHAN, DECATHLON**

**PIKIETA 26 MARCA GODZ. 14 PRZED WARSZAWSKIM SKLEPEM LEROY MERLIN, MALBORSKA 35**

**LEROY-KREMLIN IDI NACHUJ**

Kochani,

15 marca urządziliśmy małą pikietę przed warszawskim sklepem Leroy Merlin w centrum handlowym Arkadia. Powód protestu był prosty – firmy należące do grupy AFM (Mulliez) nadal nie wycofały się z rosyjskiego rynku, a nawet jak informują reżimowe media planują ekspansję korzystając z tego, że powstała luka na rynku. 

Obsługa sklepu była wyraźnie zmieszana naszym protestem, poprosili nas o opuszczenie terenu i wezwali policję. Funkcjonariusze podpierając się regulaminem galerii handlowej poinformowali nas, że narażamy się na zarzut zakłócenia miru domowego i poprosili o przeniesienie protestu poza teren galerii.

Reakcje klientów były różnorodne. Jedna pani zapytała – a czy zamierzacie protestować pod  Castoramą? Jakiś pan stwierdził – no i co, że robią interesy w Rosji? Business is businness. Ktoś inny zapytał – a dlaczego odmawiać zwykłym Rosjanom zakupów w sklepie Leroy? A gdyby ktoś nam chciał zabrać sklepy meblowe, bo mamy Kaczyńskiego? Inne osoby mówiły np. znam temat i zgadzam się. Chyba najfajniejsza reakcja była taka – nie wiedziałam o tym, już nie będę kupować w tym sklepie, albo - szkoda, że nie wiedziałem wcześniej, poszedłbym gdzie indziej. 

Nasz protest był, nie ukrywam, dość amatorski. Uczestniczyło w nim słownie 4 osoby. Jednak spowodował zgromadzenie większości pracowników ochrony sklepu, części obsługi i pewne zamieszanie, które trwało około godziny. Rozdaliśmy 400 ulotek i chodziliśmy z plakatami nawołującymi do bojkotu sklepu zgodnie z hasłem „Leroy-Kremlin idi nachuj”. Można to chyba uznać za sukces biorąc pod uwagę zaangażowane skromne środki. 

Dlatego postanowiliśmy powtórzyć to wydarzenie. Skoro pretekstem do usunięcia demonstrantów jest wejście na teren sklepu, tym razem może spotkajmy się przed wejściem do dużego sklepu Leroy Merlin na Malborskiej w Warszawie. Protest odbędzie się sobotę 26 marca o godzinie 14. Ze swojej strony postaram się zapewnić około tysiąca ulotek, kilka zalaminowanych plakatów anty-Leroy. Postaram się o muzykę na temat „Bayraktarr song”, „Putin” by Cypis itp. Chciałbym namówić wszystkie osoby, które zgadzają się i z ideą protestu do przyłączenia się. Poniżej przykład ulotki – drukowaliśmy ją w formacie A5 na zielonym papierze. Bardzo proszę o powielanie. W sieci znajduje się już sporo memów, obrazków związanych z akcją skierowaną przeciwko sklepom grupy Mulliez (Auchan, Leroy-Merlin, Decathlon). Można coś wydrukować i przynieść ze sobą. 

Gdyby ktoś chciał zorganizować podobną akcję w innym mieście, w innych sklepach Leroy, Auchan albo Decathlon byłoby jeszcze lepiej. 

A teraz najważniejsze pytanie – jaki to ma sens? W moim przekonaniu mamy niewielki wpływ na to co Rosja wyprawia na Ukrainie. Jeszcze mniejszy na działalność zachodnich biznesów w Rosji. Nie jesteśmy jednak zupełnie bezsilni jeśli chodzi o działalność korporacji działających w Polsce.

"Ukraińcy są w Polsce strasznie dyskryminowani, i to w naprawdę podły sposób. (Tylko trochę clickbait)","Panie i Panowie. 

Pewnie nie wiecie, bo jest o tym zaskakująco cicho, ale tuż obok nas ma miejsce sytuacja zupełnie nie do pomyślenia, a związana jest ona z dyskryminacją Ukraińców w Polsce. I to dyskryminacją szczególną, bo dotyczącą tylko mężczyzn. A dokładniej rzecz biorąc mężczyzn w wieku 25-60 lat. 

Żeby było ciekawiej, to dyskryminacji, i jak sądze przestępstwa, dopuszcza się polska firma działająca na terenie Polski, na takich samych prawach i zasadach, co inne firmy, na zlecenie rządu ukraińskiego. Chodzi o PP ""Dokument"" która trudni się ogarnianiem spraw około paszportowych dla mieszkających u nas Ukraińców. 

Rzecz zaś w tym, że mój znajomy złożył jakiś czas temu papiery, żeby uzyskać nowy paszport. 
Kilka tygodni później, Ukraina zaczęła przebąkiwać, że odmówi mężczyznom usług konsularnych. 

Sytuacja teraz wygląda  tak, że ci którzy złożyli papiery i zapłacili za nowy paszport, teraz nie są w stanie go odebrać - do tego, ze strony PP “Dokument” zniknęła możliwość śledzenia gdzie paszport jest - czy w druku, czy w drodze, czy w którymś z oddziałów firmy. Ci którzy dostali taką informację wcześniej - na przykład za pośrednictwem SMSa - napotykają na ""problemy techniczne"" z ich weryfikacją, i nie mogą go odebrać. Problemy, co muszę jeszcze raz podkreślić, są niewiarygodnie wybiórcze, bo dotykają tylko i wyłącznie mężczyzn w wieku poborowym. 
Co jeszcze bardziej irytujące - ukraińskie przepisy jasno mówią, co należy zrobić w przypadku takich problemów technicznych -  odpowiedź jest prosta i logiczna - zweryfikować je manualnie. 
Przypominam też, że nie weszły tam w życie żadne przepisy mówiące o tym, że należy paszporty wstrzymywać. 

Wszystko wskazuje na to, że firma stara się grać na czas, żeby po trzech miesiącach odesłać paszporty na Ukrainę, zgrywać głupa, i mówić, że teraz trzeba będzie odebrać je na Ukrainie. 

Co więcej, powołują się przy tym na ""telefon z Kijowa"", ale nic więcej - bo, jak mówiłem, żadne takie przepisy nie obowiązują. 

Pytanie brzmi - co można z tym zrobić?  Uwaga TVN nie odpowiedziała na maila, pismo do rzecznika praw obywatelskich zostało wysłane, ale biurokracja jest czasochłonna. 
Ktoś coś przebąkuje, że uchodźcy wojenni będa u nas traktowani jakby mieli ważny paszport nawet po zakończeniu jego ważności, ale to niczego nie załatwia, bo znajomy o którym mowa przyjechał do Polski przed wybuchem pałnoskalowej inwazji

Igrzyska Olimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 29.07 (poniedziałek) | Plan startów 30.07 (wtorek),"Trzeci dzień igrzysk pod względem udziału Polaków już się zakończył, więc czas na podsumowanie.

Podsumowanie, które na razie jest łatwe do do opracowania po swojemu, bo nasza ekipa pływacka nie jest tak wielka jak kiedyś (a przynajmniej tak jak ją wspominam *edit: pisząc to nie widziałem planu startów na jutro...*), a w pozostałych dyscyplinach mamy ""standardową"" liczbę zawodników. Ale już się boję dnia, gdy lekkoatletyka się zacznie...

Kolejną nowością wprowadzoną dziś, poza własnymi podsumowaniami, będzie tabelka:

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (29.07.)

#Szermierka

**Floret, mężczyźni**

*Pole trafienia: tułów.*

*Rodzaj ataku: kłucie (trzeba ""dziabnąć"" przeciwnika, z odpowiednim naciskiem).*

*Co się dzieje jak obie strony zadadzą trafienie: stosowane jest ""prawo pierwszeństwa"", które pozwala zdobyć punkt ""aktywnemu"" zawodnikowi (pierwszeństwo zaczyna się od zawodnika, który wyprowadza atak, a przejść może w ramach zablokowania klingi, najczęściej w postaci reprodukcji bloku z walki na miecze świetlne)*

- Jan Jurkiewicz:
   - 1/32 finału - **15**:8, rywal: Salim Heroui (Algieria);
   - 1/16 finału - **14**:15, rywal: Mohamed Hamza (Egipt).

- Adrian Wojtkowiak:
   - 1/32 finału - **10**:15, rywal: Alex Tofalides (Cypr).

- Michał Siess:
  - 1/16 finału - **3**:15, rywal: Alexander Choupenitch (Czechy).

Może kiedyś się nauczę na pamięć jaka broń [jak się nazywa i jakie ma zasady](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szermierka#Środki_dyscyplinarne), ale wątpię bym zdążył to zrobić zanim wszystkie zawody w szermierce się odbędą na tych igrzyskach. Chciałbym także wiedzieć kto wpadł na genialny pomysł, że organizując jedne zawody męskie i jedne zawody damskie tego samego dnia, będą się one odbywać w różnych stylach.

A co do wyników, mam wrażenie że polscy szermierzy i szermierki nie znają półśrodków - albo kończą po maksymalnie dwóch walkach, albo docierają do strefy medalowej (spostrzeżenie bazowane na danych Instytutu Danych Z Dupy na próbce ostatnich kilku igrzysk).

#Judo

*Zawody rozgrywane systemem pucharowym z repasażami ""judowymi"" (nie jestem pewien, ale chyba na wszystkie sporty na igrzyskach olimpijskich, które mają repasaże, nie ma dwóch sportów z takimi samymi zasadami repasaży). Rozdawane są dwa brązowe medale.*

*Repasaże: przegrani walk ćwierćfinałowych trafiają do dwóch walk repasażowych. Zwycięzcy tychże walczą z przegranymi z półfinałów o dwa brązowe medale.*

*Walki mają prosty system punktowania. ~~Robisz cokolwiek, dostajesz karę shido~~ Za poprawnie wykonaną technikę można dostać waza-ari (wyświetlane jak 1 punkt na tablicy wyników), albo ippon (wyświetlane jako 10 punktów, otrzymanie go oznacza automatyczną wygraną przed upływem czasu). Dwa waza-ari ""zamieniają się"" w ippon (1+1=10, system dwójkowy się kłania). Wszelaka pasywność jak i pewne nieczyste zagrania oznaczają karę shido (żółta kartka). Trzy kary shido dają ippon przeciwnikowi. Za większe przewinienie można dostać hansoku-make (czerwoną kartkę), która równa się ipponowi dla przeciwnika.*

**Kategoria do 73 kilogramów, mężczyźni**:

- Adam Stodolski:
   - 1/16 finału - **0**:10 (ippon), rywal: Manuel Lombardo (Włochy).

Do dość niedawna był trzeci rodzaj punktu (poniżej waza-ari), a jeszcze dawniej był czwarty (poniżej trzeciego). Wtedy waza-ari było odpowiednio warte 10 i 100 na tablicy wyników, a ippon 100 i 1000. Przynajmniej za czasów tego trzeciego, trzeba było czterech kar shido, by przeciwnik dostał ippon, przez co był to doskonały sport dla informatyków (heheszki z systemu dwójkowego). Teraz ta trójka wszystko psuje.

Walki niestety nie widziałem (problem z oglądaniem rzeczy na Eurosporcie jest taki, że słabo pokazują występy Polaków w dyscyplinach innych niż lekkoatletyka, tenis i siatkówka. Jak człowiek sobie o nich przypomni, to po fakcie), ale mam wrażenie, że notka z szermierki też tu pasuje - albo daleko (w czym pomagają repasaże), albo nigdzie.

#Wioślarstwo

**Dwójka podwójna kobiet**

- Martyna Radosz, Katarzyna Wełna:
   - repasaże - wygrany bieg, awans do półfinału.

Miały trochę ""pecha"" w kwalifikacjach, bo czas jaki osiągnęły w swoim biegu dałby awans bezpośrednio do półfinału w każdym innych. Ale na dziś misja została wykonana.

#Tenis stołowy

**Turniej indywidualny kobiet**

- Natalia Bajor:
   - 1/32 finału - **4**:3 (11:8, 3:11, 8:11, 11:7, 10:12, 11:5), rywalka: Suthasini Sawettabut (Tajlandia).

- Katarzyna Węgrzyn:
   - 1/32 finału - **1**:4 (7:11, 11:9, 12:14, 9:11, 6:11), rywalka: Linda Bergstrom (Szwecja).

Wygląda na to, że na razie w ciągu dnia odbywa się tylko jedna runda. Natalię zobaczymy w następnej rundzie. 

#Jeździectwo

*Zawody drużynowe odbywają się jednocześnie z indywidualnymi (zawodnicy należący do drużyny zdobywają punkty do obu, chyba że są zastępstwem w późniejszej konkurencji WKKW).*

**Wszechstronny Konkurs Konia Wierzchowego, indywidualnie**

*Dzisiaj odbyła się trzecia, ostatnia konkurencja WKKW, skoki przez przeszkody. Najlepszych 25 zawodników (plus ktokolwiek ex-aequo z ostatnim zakwalifikowanym zawodnikiem) przeszło do finału, który polega na dodatkowej rundzie skoków przez przeszkody. Im mniejszy wynik, tym wyższe miejsce.*

- Małgorzata Korycka:
   - ostatecznie 39. miejsce.

- Robert Powała:
   - ostatecznie 48. miejsce.

- Jan Kamiński:
   - nieklasyfikowany, wyeliminowany w/po drugiej konkurencji (z nieznanych mi powodów nie ukończył przejazdu).

- Wiktoria Knap:
   - nieklasyfikowana, zastąpiła Jana na trzecią konkurencję w zawodach drużynowych.

**Wszechstronny Konkurs Konia Wierzchowego, drużynowo**

- Polska:
   - ostatecznie 16. miejsce.

Moim największym bólem w przypadku tej konkurencji to brak polskiego komentarza, przynajmniej na Maxie/Eurosporcie. Skoki do wody albo próbę terenową przyjemnie się ogląda, ale w chaosie wielu dyscyplin lecących w tle i robienia także innych rzeczy na komputerze, lubię jak ktoś mi opowiada o tym co mnie mija. A do ujeżdżenia to już na pewno trzeba komentarz kogoś, kto wie na co zwracać uwagę.

#Pływanie

**100 metrów stylem grzbietowym, kobiety**

- Adela Piskorska:
   - kwalifikacje - 17. miejsce.\*

\* Adela nie awansowała do półfinału, ale w wypadku gdy ktoś z półfinalistów nie mógłby wystartować (zakładam, że musiałby to zgłosić wystarczająco wcześnie), to może wejść na jego miejsce.

#Tenis

**Turniej indywidualny kobiet**

- Iga Świątek:
   - 1/16 finału - **6**:1, **6**:1, rywalka: Diane Parry (Francja).

- Magda Linette:
   - 1/16 finału - **4**:6, **1:6**, rywalka: Jasmine Paolini (Włochy).

Korty ziemne ""zachowują się"" inaczej zależnie od pogody. Przy dużej wilgotności powietrza (często związanej z opadami deszczu, co powoduje zamknięcie dachu) zachowują się podobnie do innych kortów, z piłką odbijającą się od gruntu niżej i szybciej. Przy pełnym słońcu piłki odbijają się wolniej i wyżej, wzmacniając wszelakie efekty podkręcenia piłki. W pierwszym warunkach Iga ma ""problemy"", w drugich jest w swoim żywiole (bo doskonale potrafi wykorzystać zachowanie piłki w tych warunkach). W wielkim skrócie, PRAISE THE SUN \\[T]/

**Turniej deblowy kobiet**

*W turnieju deblowym występuje 32 pary, walczące w systemie pucharowym. Ta sama ""część finału"" odbywa się rundę wcześniej niż w turnieju singlowym (np. 1/16 finału to runda druga turnieju singlowego, ale pierwsza deblowego).*

- Magda Linette, Alicja Rosolska:
   - 1/16 finału - **4**:6, **1**:6, rywalki: Marta Kostiuk, Dajana Jastremska (Ukraina).

#Żeglarstwo

*Powtórka zasad:*

*\- w każdej konkurencji poza iQFoil - odbywa się 10.-12. wyścigów kwalifikacyjnych, załogi dostają punkty równe zajęte pozycji (ostatnia pozycja w przypadku dyskwalifikacji, chyba mogą się zdarzyć kary punktowe). Im mniej punktów tym lepiej, a do tego najgorszy wynik jest ""wykreślany"" (więc można skopać jeden wyścig albo dostać jedną dyskwalifikację, ale nie więcej jeżeli chce się walczyć o medale). Do wyścigu medalowego awansuje 10 najlepszych załóg. Wyścig medalowy jest punktowany podwójnie.*

*\- iQFoil (przyznaję, że nie znam tej konkurencji, więc zgaduję rzeczy na podstawie urywków wiadomości) - odbywa się 10+ wyścigów kwalifikacyjnych, załogi dostają punkty równe zajętej pozycji (ostatnia pozycja w przypadku dyskwalifikacji, mogą się zdarzyć kary punktowe (np. Holenderka dostała 1.3 punktu w pierwszym wyścigu)). Im mniej punktów tym lepiej, ale nie wiem czy odejmuje się tu najgorszy wynik. Po zakończeniu fazy kwalifikacyjnej:*

 - *najlepsza załoga awansuje do finału;*

 - *druga i trzecia załoga awansuje do półfinału;*

 - *od czwartej do dziesiątej, wszystkie te załogi awansują do ćwierćfinału.*

*Jak te fazy działają? Nie wiem (jeszcze).*

**iQFoil, kobiety**

- Maja Dziarnowska:
   - 1. wyścig: 7. miejsce;
   - 2. wyścig: 10. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **7.** miejsce.

**QFoil, mężczyźni**

- Paweł Tarnowski:
   - 1. wyścig: 12. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **12.** miejsce.

**49er FX, kobiety**

- Aleksandra Melzacka, Sandra Jankowiak:
   - 4. wyścig: 11. miejsce;
   - 5. wyścig: 18. miejsce;
   - 6. wyścig: 15. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **18.** miejsce.

**49er, mężczyźni**

- Dominik Buksak, Szymon Wierzbicki
   - 4. wyścig: 1. miejsce;
   - 5. wyścig: 18. miejsce;
   - 6. wyścig: 15. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **9.** miejsce.

Magiczna konkurencja, dzieje się tam, gdzie nie ma kamer. A jak w końcu złapię wyścig na akwenie z kamerami, to najwyraźniej jest ostatnim.

Magiczna konkurencja także z powodu tego, że pomiędzy punktami kontrolnymi łódź, która prowadziła, może nagle spaść o tonę pozycji, tylko po to by zaraz je odzyskać. Przewidywanie/Zgadywanie gdzie jest lepszy wiatr to kluczowa zdolność.

#Kolarstwo górskie

**Wyścig mężczyzn**:

- Krzysztof Łukasik:
   - 27. miejsce.

#Kajakarstwo slalomowe

**Kanadyjki (C1), mężczyźni**

*16 zawodników walczyło w półfinale o 12 miejsce w finale. Kto osiągnie najszybszy czas (po doliczeniu kar za uderzenie w słupek (2 sekund) i ominięcie bramki (50 sekund)) wygrywa.*

- Grzegorz Hedwig:
   - półfinał: 12. miejsce;
   - finał: 10. miejsce.

Konia z rzędem, bez konia z rzędem, temu kto mi wytłumaczy czym się różni kajak od kanadyjki, przynajmniej te slalomowe (bo jak dobrze pamiętam wyścigi na torach wioślarskich, to mają kompletnie inne pozycje w porównaniu do tych w slalomie).

I szkoda, że obie łodzie po polsku zaczynają się na `K`, bo właśnie miałem kryzys w związku z tym, które to K, a które to C (bo z jakiegoś powodu pomyślałem, że po angielsku kajak jest przez c... A nie przypomniałem sobie w tym momencie, że kanadyjka to canoe, po prostu nazwa niepodobna).

Niby nazywam to TL;DR, ale jak się nad tym zastanawiam, to dla niektórych to wciąż może być za dużo tekstu, chociaż krócej raczej się nie da: [Może TL;DR na stronie TVP](https://sport.tvp.pl/79525268/io-paryz-2024-starty-medale-i-wyniki-polakow-na-igrzyskach-olimpijskich-29-lipca).

-------------------------------------------------

#Plan występów w dniu 30.07.

W niektórych przypadkach godziny oznaczają początki sesji konkurencji, w których Polacy będą startować w późniejszych meczach/walkach/pojedynkach/biegach.

A link w tej sekcji to chyba w ogóle ma więcej treści niż ja postuję XD Więc chyba lepiej będzie go nazywać [źródłem informacji](https://sport.tvp.pl/79248721/starty-polakow-we-wtorek-30072024-na-olimpiadzie-gdzie-ogladac-transmisje-na-zywo-z-io-paryz-terminarz) (artykuł aktualizowany, w ciągu dnia zmienia się w listę wyników Polek i Polaków).

Pogrubieniem zaznaczyłem konkurencje ""bardzo blisko medalowe"", w których mamy pewny udział (w przypadku wyścigów wieloosobowych będą to finały, gdzie jest tak z 8-, może 10-, zawodników; w przypadku sportów `X vs Y` ćwierćfinały lub lepiej). *Edit: Zależnie od chęci, mogę upgrade'ować potencjalne następne rundy, jeżeli do nich awansujemy.*

Kursywą zaznaczyłem konkurencje w których nie ma pewności, że będziemy mieć przedstawiciela (bo np. odpadnie wcześniej). A czasy wyścigów żeglarskich traktujcie z przymrużeniem oka.

9:00 – siatkówka plażowa mężczyzn, grupa C – preeliminacje (faza grupowa bodajże): Polska – Australia (Michał Bryl, Bartosz Łosiak)

10:00 – judo, -63kg kobiet – faza eliminacyjna (Angelika Szymańska)

Jeżeli wygra dwie walki, ma pewny występ popołudniu (bo przejdzie 1/16 i 1/8 finału i trafi do ćwierćfinału. A jak wspomniałem w sekcji Judo, to zapewnia udział przynajmniej w repasażach)

11:00 – pływanie, 200m st. motylkowym mężczyzn – eliminacje (Michał Chmielewski, Krzysztof Chmielewski)

11:00 – tenis stołowy kobiet – 1/16 finału: Fu Yu vs. Natalia Bajor

12:00 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym mężczyzn – eliminacje (Jakub Majerski)

12:13 – żeglarstwo, klasa iQFoil kobiet – wyścigi 6-10 (Maja Dziarnowska)

12:39 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym kobiet – eliminacje (Kornelia Fiedkiewicz)

12:51 – pływanie, 200m st. klasycznym mężczyzn – eliminacje (Jan Kałusowski)

~~13:06 – ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Sandra Sysojeva)~~ (konkurencja wielodniowa: startuje jutro, dzięki za info u/Available_Fail_9399 )

13:28 – ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Katarzyna Milczarek)

**13:30 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – ćwierćfinał Polska vs. USA (Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)**

W drużynie występują 3 panie (czwarta - rezerwowa), walka trwa 9x3 minut, gdzie każdy walczy z każdym, przy czym w jednej ""sekcji"" pojedynku, JEŻELI DOBRZE PAMIĘTAM, jeżeli drużyna prowadząca będzie miała liczbę punktów równą pięciokrotności numeru rundy, kończy się ona przed czasem (więc jak w czwartej rundzie będzie 20:12, to nie ważne ile czasu zostało - następuje jej koniec). Walka trwa do 45. punktu, albo do końca czasu, dogrywka chyba działa jak w walce indywidualnej.

13:44 – łucznictwo kobiet – eliminacje 1/32 finału: Ankita Bhakat vs. Wioleta Myszor

~~14:04 – ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Żaneta Skowrońska-Kozubik)~~ (wycofana, koń nie przeszedł przeglądu (konie są ""równie ważne"" co ludzie w jeździectwie, jeżeli one nie są w pełni sprawne, para nie może wystąpić))

~~XX:XX: - ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Aleksandra Szulc)~~ (zastępstwo za Skowronśką-Kozubik: też startuje jutro)

14:17 – żeglarstwo, klasa iQFoil mężczyzn – wyścigi ~~6-10~~ jakieś (Paweł Tarnowski)

15:00 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje C1 kobiet – 1. wyścig (Klaudia Zwolińska)

15:46 – żeglarstwo, klasa 49er kobiet – wyścigi 7-9 (Aleksandra Melzacka, Sandra Jankowiak)

**15:50 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – półfinał (~~ew.~~ Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)**

16:00 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje K1 mężczyzn – 1. wyścig (Mateusz Polaczyk)

*16:00 – judo, -63kg kobiet – faza finałowa (ew. Angelika Szymańska)*

16:35 – żeglarstwo, klasa 49er mężczyzn – wyścigi 7-9 (Dominik Buksak, Szymon Wierzbicki)

17:10 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje C1 kobiet – 2. wyścig (Klaudia Zwolińska)

*17:45 – łucznictwo kobiet – eliminacje 1/16 finału (ew. Wioleta Myszor)*

18:10 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje K1 mężczyzn – 2. wyścig (Mateusz Polaczyk)

19:00 – tenis, 3. runda kobiet: Iga Świątek vs. Xiyu Wang

**19:30 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – mecz o 3. miejsce (Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)**

*20:30 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym mężczyzn – półfinał (ew. Jakub Majerski)*

~~*20:30 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – finał (ew. Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)*~~

*20:42 – pływanie, 200m st. motylkowym mężczyzn – półfinał (ew. Michał Chmielewski, Krzysztof Chmielewski)*

*20:56 – pływanie, 100m st. grzbietowym kobiet – finał (ew. Adela Piskorska jako rezerwowa)*

*21:25 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym kobiet – półfinał (ew. Kornelia Fiedkiewicz)*

*21:47 – pływanie, 200m st. klasycznym mężczyzn – półfinał (ew. Jan Kałusowski)*

22:05 – koszykówka 3x3 mężczyzn – runda wstępna (chyba faza grupowa): Polska vs. Francja

22:24 – boks, 57kg kobiet – preeliminacje: Alcala Cegovia vs. Julia Szeremeta",Polska,2024-07-29 20:48:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/1efafjs/igrzyska_olimpijskie_wyniki_polaków_i_polek_2907/,"Igrzyska Olimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 29.07 (poniedziałek) | Plan startów 30.07 (wtorek) Trzeci dzień igrzysk pod względem udziału Polaków już się zakończył, więc czas na podsumowanie.

W pierwszym warunkach Iga ma ""problemy"", w drugich jest w swoim żywiole (bo doskonale potrafi wykorzystać zachowanie piłki w tych warunkach). W wielkim skrócie, PRAISE THE SUN \\[T]/

**Turniej deblowy kobiet**

*W turnieju deblowym występuje 32 pary, walczące w systemie pucharowym. Ta sama ""część finału"" odbywa się rundę wcześniej niż w turnieju singlowym (np. 1/16 finału to runda druga turnieju singlowego, ale pierwsza deblowego).*

- Magda Linette, Alicja Rosolska:
   - 1/16 finału - **4**:6, **1**:6, rywalki: Marta Kostiuk, Dajana Jastremska (Ukraina).

#Żeglarstwo

*Powtórka zasad:*

*\- w każdej konkurencji poza iQFoil - odbywa się 10.-12. wyścigów kwalifikacyjnych, załogi dostają punkty równe zajęte pozycji (ostatnia pozycja w przypadku dyskwalifikacji, chyba mogą się zdarzyć kary punktowe). Im mniej punktów tym lepiej, a do tego najgorszy wynik jest ""wykreślany"" (więc można skopać jeden wyścig albo dostać jedną dyskwalifikację, ale nie więcej jeżeli chce się walczyć o medale). Do wyścigu medalowego awansuje 10 najlepszych załóg. Wyścig medalowy jest punktowany podwójnie.*

*\- iQFoil (przyznaję, że nie znam tej konkurencji, więc zgaduję rzeczy na podstawie urywków wiadomości) - odbywa się 10+ wyścigów kwalifikacyjnych, załogi dostają punkty równe zajętej pozycji (ostatnia pozycja w przypadku dyskwalifikacji, mogą się zdarzyć kary punktowe (np. Holenderka dostała 1.3 punktu w pierwszym wyścigu)). Im mniej punktów tym lepiej, ale nie wiem czy odejmuje się tu najgorszy wynik. Po zakończeniu fazy kwalifikacyjnej:*

 - *najlepsza załoga awansuje do finału;*

 - *druga i trzecia załoga awansuje do półfinału;*

 - *od czwartej do dziesiątej, wszystkie te załogi awansują do ćwierćfinału.*

*Jak te fazy działają? Nie wiem (jeszcze).*

**iQFoil, kobiety**

- Maja Dziarnowska:
   - 1. wyścig: 7. miejsce;
   - 2. wyścig: 10. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **7.** miejsce.

**QFoil, mężczyźni**

- Paweł Tarnowski:
   - 1. wyścig: 12. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **12.** miejsce.

**49er FX, kobiety**

- Aleksandra Melzacka, Sandra Jankowiak:
   - 4. wyścig: 11. miejsce;
   - 5. wyścig: 18. miejsce;
   - 6. wyścig: 15. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **18.** miejsce.

**49er, mężczyźni**

- Dominik Buksak, Szymon Wierzbicki
   - 4. wyścig: 1. miejsce;
   - 5. wyścig: 18. miejsce;
   - 6. wyścig: 15. miejsce;
   - ogólnie: **9.** miejsce.

Magiczna konkurencja, dzieje się tam, gdzie nie ma kamer. A jak w końcu złapię wyścig na akwenie z kamerami, to najwyraźniej jest ostatnim.

Magiczna konkurencja także z powodu tego, że pomiędzy punktami kontrolnymi łódź, która prowadziła, może nagle spaść o tonę pozycji, tylko po to by zaraz je odzyskać. Przewidywanie/Zgadywanie gdzie jest lepszy wiatr to kluczowa zdolność.

#Kolarstwo górskie

**Wyścig mężczyzn**:

- Krzysztof Łukasik:
   - 27. miejsce.

#Kajakarstwo slalomowe

**Kanadyjki (C1), mężczyźni**

*16 zawodników walczyło w półfinale o 12 miejsce w finale. Kto osiągnie najszybszy czas (po doliczeniu kar za uderzenie w słupek (2 sekund) i ominięcie bramki (50 sekund)) wygrywa.*

- Grzegorz Hedwig:
   - półfinał: 12. miejsce;
   - finał: 10. miejsce.

Konia z rzędem, bez konia z rzędem, temu kto mi wytłumaczy czym się różni kajak od kanadyjki, przynajmniej te slalomowe (bo jak dobrze pamiętam wyścigi na torach wioślarskich, to mają kompletnie inne pozycje w porównaniu do tych w slalomie).

I szkoda, że obie łodzie po polsku zaczynają się na `K`, bo właśnie miałem kryzys w związku z tym, które to K, a które to C (bo z jakiegoś powodu pomyślałem, że po angielsku kajak jest przez c... A nie przypomniałem sobie w tym momencie, że kanadyjka to canoe, po prostu nazwa niepodobna).

Niby nazywam to TL;DR, ale jak się nad tym zastanawiam, to dla niektórych to wciąż może być za dużo tekstu, chociaż krócej raczej się nie da: [Może TL;DR na stronie TVP](https://sport.tvp.pl/79525268/io-paryz-2024-starty-medale-i-wyniki-polakow-na-igrzyskach-olimpijskich-29-lipca).

-------------------------------------------------

#Plan występów w dniu 30.07.

W niektórych przypadkach godziny oznaczają początki sesji konkurencji, w których Polacy będą startować w późniejszych meczach/walkach/pojedynkach/biegach.

A link w tej sekcji to chyba w ogóle ma więcej treści niż ja postuję XD Więc chyba lepiej będzie go nazywać [źródłem informacji](https://sport.tvp.pl/79248721/starty-polakow-we-wtorek-30072024-na-olimpiadzie-gdzie-ogladac-transmisje-na-zywo-z-io-paryz-terminarz) (artykuł aktualizowany, w ciągu dnia zmienia się w listę wyników Polek i Polaków).

Pogrubieniem zaznaczyłem konkurencje ""bardzo blisko medalowe"", w których mamy pewny udział (w przypadku wyścigów wieloosobowych będą to finały, gdzie jest tak z 8-, może 10-, zawodników; w przypadku sportów `X vs Y` ćwierćfinały lub lepiej). *Edit: Zależnie od chęci, mogę upgrade'ować potencjalne następne rundy, jeżeli do nich awansujemy.*

Kursywą zaznaczyłem konkurencje w których nie ma pewności, że będziemy mieć przedstawiciela (bo np. odpadnie wcześniej). A czasy wyścigów żeglarskich traktujcie z przymrużeniem oka.

9:00 – siatkówka plażowa mężczyzn, grupa C – preeliminacje (faza grupowa bodajże): Polska – Australia (Michał Bryl, Bartosz Łosiak)

10:00 – judo, -63kg kobiet – faza eliminacyjna (Angelika Szymańska)

Jeżeli wygra dwie walki, ma pewny występ popołudniu (bo przejdzie 1/16 i 1/8 finału i trafi do ćwierćfinału. A jak wspomniałem w sekcji Judo, to zapewnia udział przynajmniej w repasażach)

11:00 – pływanie, 200m st. motylkowym mężczyzn – eliminacje (Michał Chmielewski, Krzysztof Chmielewski)

11:00 – tenis stołowy kobiet – 1/16 finału: Fu Yu vs. Natalia Bajor

12:00 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym mężczyzn – eliminacje (Jakub Majerski)

12:13 – żeglarstwo, klasa iQFoil kobiet – wyścigi 6-10 (Maja Dziarnowska)

12:39 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym kobiet – eliminacje (Kornelia Fiedkiewicz)

12:51 – pływanie, 200m st. klasycznym mężczyzn – eliminacje (Jan Kałusowski)

~~13:06 – ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Sandra Sysojeva)~~ (konkurencja wielodniowa: startuje jutro, dzięki za info u/Available_Fail_9399 )

13:28 – ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Katarzyna Milczarek)

**13:30 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – ćwierćfinał Polska vs. USA (Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)**

W drużynie występują 3 panie (czwarta - rezerwowa), walka trwa 9x3 minut, gdzie każdy walczy z każdym, przy czym w jednej ""sekcji"" pojedynku, JEŻELI DOBRZE PAMIĘTAM, jeżeli drużyna prowadząca będzie miała liczbę punktów równą pięciokrotności numeru rundy, kończy się ona przed czasem (więc jak w czwartej rundzie będzie 20:12, to nie ważne ile czasu zostało - następuje jej koniec). Walka trwa do 45. punktu, albo do końca czasu, dogrywka chyba działa jak w walce indywidualnej.

13:44 – łucznictwo kobiet – eliminacje 1/32 finału: Ankita Bhakat vs. Wioleta Myszor

~~14:04 – ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Żaneta Skowrońska-Kozubik)~~ (wycofana, koń nie przeszedł przeglądu (konie są ""równie ważne"" co ludzie w jeździectwie, jeżeli one nie są w pełni sprawne, para nie może wystąpić))

~~XX:XX: - ujeżdżanie drużynowe i indywidualne (Aleksandra Szulc)~~ (zastępstwo za Skowronśką-Kozubik: też startuje jutro)

14:17 – żeglarstwo, klasa iQFoil mężczyzn – wyścigi ~~6-10~~ jakieś (Paweł Tarnowski)

15:00 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje C1 kobiet – 1. wyścig (Klaudia Zwolińska)

15:46 – żeglarstwo, klasa 49er kobiet – wyścigi 7-9 (Aleksandra Melzacka, Sandra Jankowiak)

**15:50 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – półfinał (~~ew.~~ Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)**

16:00 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje K1 mężczyzn – 1. wyścig (Mateusz Polaczyk)

*16:00 – judo, -63kg kobiet – faza finałowa (ew. Angelika Szymańska)*

16:35 – żeglarstwo, klasa 49er mężczyzn – wyścigi 7-9 (Dominik Buksak, Szymon Wierzbicki)

17:10 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje C1 kobiet – 2. wyścig (Klaudia Zwolińska)

*17:45 – łucznictwo kobiet – eliminacje 1/16 finału (ew. Wioleta Myszor)*

18:10 – slalom kajakowy, eliminacje K1 mężczyzn – 2. wyścig (Mateusz Polaczyk)

19:00 – tenis, 3. runda kobiet: Iga Świątek vs. Xiyu Wang

**19:30 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – mecz o 3. miejsce (Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)**

*20:30 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym mężczyzn – półfinał (ew. Jakub Majerski)*

~~*20:30 – szermierka, szpada kobiet drużynowo – finał (ew. Walczyk-Klimaszyk, Jelińska, Łyczbińska, Martyna Synoradzka)*~~

*21:25 – pływanie, 100m st. dowolnym kobiet – półfinał (ew. Kornelia Fiedkiewicz)*

*21:47 – pływanie, 200m st. klasycznym mężczyzn – półfinał (ew. Jan Kałusowski)*

22:05 – koszykówka 3x3 mężczyzn – runda wstępna (chyba faza grupowa): Polska vs. Francja

22:24 – boks, 57kg kobiet – preeliminacje: Alcala Cegovia vs. Julia Szeremeta",negative

Igrzyska Olimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 08.08 (czwartek) | Plan startów 09.08 (piątek),"Trzynasty dzień Igrzysk (licząc od ceremonii otwarcia/od pierwszego startu Polaków) za nami. Zostały tylko trzy dni, ale jeżeli strona Igrzysk mnie nie okłamuje (co robiła w przeszłości), to w niedzielę nie startuje żaden Polak ani Polka, więc zostały tylko dwa dni tych postów. *Moooooooooże* dodatkowo w niedzielę wieczór walnę jakiś pseudo-zbiorczy post, ale poza tabelkami nie spodziewajcie się niczego więcej niż ściany linków do starych postów. Głównie dlatego, że nawet jakbym okroił wszystko do czystych danych, to chyba wciąż bym się nie zmieścił w limicie 40k znaków.

Część ludzi uważa 13 za pechową liczbę. I ~~dzisiejszy~~ ten dzień to potwierdza, bo wystarczyłby jeden podróżnik w czasie przesuwający jedno krzesło, by tabelka medalowa zyskała sporo nowych nazwisk.

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (08.08.)

#Lekkoatletyka

**Siedmiobój, kobiety**

 - Adrianna Sułek-Schubert:
    - 100 metrów przez płotki: 6. miejsce;
    - skok wzwyż: 8. miejsce;
    - pchnięcie kulą: 12. miejsce;
    - 200 metrów: 10. miejsce:
    - 4/7 konkurencji: 8. miejsce.

W piątek odbędą się skok w dal, rzut oszczepem i bieg na 800 metrów.

Nie ma za bardzo co oczekiwać walki o podium, bo Polka ma sporą stratę do Top 3, a do tego jest technika rzutu oszczepem (a szczególnie [bieg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCedsbbRkJA)) nie jest/była najlepsza, ale jeżeli skończy w Top 8 to wciąż to będzie sukces, szczególnie że Adrianna wróciła po przerwie macierzyńskiej.

**Pchnięcie kulą, kobiety**

 - Klaudia Kardasz:
    - kwalifikacje: **19.** miejsce.

**4x100 metrów, kobiety**

*Półfinał: awans - 3+2 do finału.*

 - Polska (Magdalena Niemczyk, Kryscina Cimanouska, Magdalena Stefanowicz, Ewa Swoboda):
    - półfinał: **5.** miejsce w biegu. Brak awansu z czasem.

**800 metrów, mężczyźni**

*Repasaże: awans - 1+2 do półfinału.*

 - Mateusz Borkowski:
    - repasaże: **6.** miejsce w biegu.

**1500 metrów, kobiety**

*Półfinał: awans - 6+0 do finału.*

 - Klaudia Kazimierska:
    - półfinał: 5. miejsce w biegu.

 - Weronika Lizakowska:
    - półfinał: **7.** miejsce w biegu.

Obie Polki zasługują na brawa za swoje biegi, nawet jeżeli efekty były całkowicie odmienne. Klaudia pobiła swój rekord życiowy, zapewniając sobie miejsce w finale, a Weronika ustanowiła nowy rekord Polski, ale niestety rywalki w jej biegu były jeszcze szybsze (jej czas dałby jej zwycięstwo w biegu Klaudii).

#Kajakarstwo

**C1, 200 metrów, kobiety**

*Kwalifikacje: 2 najszybsze zawodniczki w biegu do półfinału, reszta do ćwierćfinału.*

*Ćwierćfinał: 2 najszybsze zawodniczki w biegu do półfinału.*

*Półfinał: 4 najszybsze zawodniczki w biegu do finału A, reszta do finału B.*

 - Dorota Borowska:
    - kwalifikacje: 1. miejsce w biegu.

 - Katarzyna Szperkiewicz:
    - kwalifikacje: 4. miejsce w biegu;
    - ćwierćfinał: **3.** miejsce w biegu.

**K4, 500 metrów, kobiety**

 - Karolina Naja, Anna Puławska, Adrianna Kąkol, Dominika Putto:
    - finał: **4.** miejsce.

No niestety, w tym roku nie udało się ""Atomówkom"" zdobyć medalu na Igrzyskach. Przy czym ta nazwa chyba obowiązuje tylko osadę czteroosobową, bo 3 z 4 pań będą jeszcze startować w innych konkurencjach.

#Pięciobój nowoczesny

*W tym roku jeździectwo (a dokładniej skoki przez przeszkody) jest jeszcze częścią pięcioboju nowoczesnego, ale chyba od następnych Igrzysk nastąpi już zmiana na taki pseudo-Ninja Warrior tor.*

*Dziś odbyła się runda rankingowa szermierki, ale nie jestem pewien do czego jej wyniki będą użyte. W tym sensie, że najwyraźniej będą dwa półfinały przed finałami (piątek i sobota dla mężczyzn, sobota i niedziela dla kobiet), a o ile wszystkie pozostałe konkurencje (w tym runda bonusowa szermierki) odbywają się dla obu faz, widziałem tylko jedną rundę rankingową (która przydziela punkty do zawodów, a nie tylko ustala numery startowe).*

**Mężczyźni**

 - Łukasz Gutkowski:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 8. miejsce.

 - Kamil Kasperczak:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 9. miejsce.

**Kobiety**

 - Anna Maliszewska:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 20. miejsce.

 - Natalia Dominiak:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 31. miejsce.

#Zapasy

*Za jedną technikę można zdobyć od 1 do 5 punktów.*

*W stylu wolnym można atakować całe ciało rywala (no może poza głową, choć już szyi pewny nie jestem). W stylu dowolnym nie wolno atakować nóg.*

*W stylu klasycznym przewaga 8 punktów kończy walkę przed czasem. W stylu wolnym potrzeba aż 10 punktów przewagi by zakończyć walkę przed czasem.*

**Styl klasyczny, kategoria do 87 kilogramów, mężczyźni**

 - Arkadiusz Kułynycz:
    - repasaż: 3:1, rywal: Carlos Munoz Jaramillo (Kolumbia);
    - walka o brązowy medal: **1**:3, rywal: Zhan Beleniuk (Ukraina).

Mimo spotkania na swojej drodze mistrza świata (Turek z 1/8 finału) i mistrza olimpijskiego (Ukrainiec), Polak nie był wcale tak daleko od zdobycia brązowego medalu. No ale niestety skończyło się na niczym.

**Styl wolny,  kategoria do 57 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - Anhelina Łysak:
    - 1/8 finału: 13:16, rywalka: Alina Hrushyna Akobiia (Ukraina):
       - ćwierćfinał Aliny: 4:7, rywalka: Helen Louise Maroulis (USA).
    - pierwszy dzień: Polka odpadła z rywalizacji.

Pomiędzy dwoma czwartymi miejscami (choć można się kłócić, że w przypadku zapasów przegrany walki o brąz kończy na 5. miejscu, bo dwóch zawodników dostaje brązowy medal) to Anhelina zdobywa tytuł ""pokonanej przez liczbę 13"" (przy czym oryginalnie myślałem tylko o 13. dniu Igrzysk. Fakt że zdobyła 13 punktów jest bonusem). Bo gdyby punktowanie walk (a szczególnie ""wyższości zawodnika"") była taka sama w stylu wolnym jak w stylu klasycznym, to reprezentantka Polski wygrałaby przed czasem, gdyż w pewnym momencie prowadziła ośmioma punktami, 13:5. Ale niestety osłabła ona z sił, gdy nowe wstąpiły w Ukrainkę i była ona w stanie odrobić tę wielką stratę. 

#Żeglarstwo

CUD SIĘ STAŁ. Możliwym było odbycie zawodów żeglarskich dzisiaj. Wciąż z problemami, ale się ścigali.

**Formuła Kite, kobiety**

*Dobra, ogarnąłem jak działa faza finałowa.*

*Zawodniczki z miejsc od trzeciego do dziesiątego z fazy klasyfikacyjnej przechodzą do półfinałów, gdzie dzieli się je na dwie grupy (pewnie w schemacie, że miejsca 3-4 trafiają do różnych grup, tak jak miejsca 5-6, 7-8 i 9-10). Półfinały odbywają się na zasadzie ""pierwszy, kto wygra 3 wyścigi, przechodzi do finału"", przy czym zawodnicy z miejsc 3-4 dostają ""dwa darmowe zwycięstwa"", a zawodnicy z miejsc 5-6 jedno. Co oznacza, że o ile Polka musiałaby wygrać 3 wyścigi żeby awansować, to Holenderce, która weszła do półfinału z miejsc 3-4 wystarczyło wygrać jeden wyścig, by wygrać półfinał, co też uczyniła. Pozostałe miejsca są decydowane według tego, kto wygrał więcej biegów (licząc darmowe), a w przypadku dalszego remisu, liczy się punkty zdobyte w biegach (im mniej tym lepiej).*

*Zawodniczki z miejsc pierwszego i drugiego z fazy klasyfikacyjnej przechodzą bezpośrednio do finału. Zwyciężczyni fazy klasyfikacyjnej dostaje dwie darmowe wygrane, zawodniczka z drugiego miejsca jedną, a zawodniczki które awansowały z półfinałów zero. I znowu ścigami się do 3 zwycięstw, a reszta miejsc jest obstawiona według tego samego schematu co półfinał.*

 - Julia Damasiewicz:
    - półfinał: **3. miejsce** w grupie.

#Kolarstwo torowe

*Jeżeli myśleliście, że żeglarstwo ma dziwne zasady, szczególnie Formuła Kite, to przedstawiam wam króla pojebanych konkurencji - kolarstwo torowe, gdzie [konkurencja bazująca na grze hazardowej](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolarstwo_torowe#Keirin) jest potencjalnie najprostszą, najnormalniejszą dyscypliną.*

**Sprint, mężczyźni**

*Zawodnicy pokonują 3 okrążenia. Czas jest mierzony tylko na ostatnim. Przed każdą rundą poza kwalifikacjami losowana jest kolejność zawodników, którą muszą zachować przez pierwsze pół okrążenia. Potem mogą robić wszystko, włącznie ze stójką na torze, by przeciwnik musiał cię wyprzedzić, chyba że sam stanie w miejscu (przy czym chyba nie można dotknąć stopą toru).*

*Jak skomplikować prostą dyscyplinę, gdzie można kazać dwóm zawodnikom walczyć przeciwko sobie (bo po prostu jazda na czas, jak choćby w kolarstwie szosowym to już w ogóle byłoby zbyt proste)? Otóż tak:*

 - *w sesji kwalifikacyjnej/próbie czasowej 30 zawodników jedzie samotnie, by ustalić jak najlepszy czas. 24 zawodników przechodzi dalej;*

 - *w 1/32 finału 24 zawodników startuje w parach bazujących na miejscach zajętych w próbie czasowej (1. z 24., 2. z 23., itd.). Wygrani biegu przechodzą do 1/16 finału, przegrani przechodzą do repasażu/repesażu (z oryginalnego języka, francuskiego, powinno się mówić/pisać repEsaż, ale w polskim obie formy są poprawne) 1/32 finału;*

 - *w repesażu 1/32 finału 12 zawodników startuje w 4 biegach po 3 zawodników. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do 1/16 finału, przegrani odpadają;*

 - *w 1/16 finału 16 zawodników (w normalnej 1/16 finału normalnego systemu pucharowego 1vs1 startuje 32 zawodników/drużyn) startuje w parach, które nie jestem do końca pewien jak są stworzone (nie widzę schematu między jakimkolwiek wyścigiem zawierającym zawodników, którzy przeszli repasaże, a parami tej rundy, a strona Olimpiady nie mówi takich rzeczy). Zwycięzcy biegu przechodzą do 1/8 finału, przegrani przechodzą do repesaży 1/16 finału;*

 - *w repesażu 1/16 finału 8 zawodników startuje w 4 biegach po 2 zawodników. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do 1/8 finału, przegrani odpadają;*

 - *w 1/8 finału 12 zawodników startuje w parach. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do ćwierćfinału, przegrani do, zgadliście, repesaży 1/8 finału;*

 - *w repesażu 1/8 finału 6 zawodników startuje w 2 biegach po 3 zawodników. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do ćwierćfinału, przegrani odpadają;*

*Tutaj kończy się dzień pierwszy zawodów.*

 - *w ćwierćfinale 8 zawodników startuje w parach. Kto pierwszy wygra dwa wyścigi w parze przechodzi do półfinału, przegrany przechodzi do wyścigu o miejsca 5.-8.;*

 - *w biegu o miejsca 5.-8. 4 zawodników startuje w jednym biegu. Kto pierwszy dojedzie do mety, ten najlepszy (czyli na 5. miejscu);*

*Tutaj kończy się dzień drugi zawodów. Choć w przypadku kobiet ich bieg o miejsca 5.-8. jest zaplanowany na trzeci dzień.*
 
 - *w półfinale 4 zawodników startuje w parach. Kto pierwszy wygra dwa wyścigi w parze przechodzi do finału. Kto przegra przechodzi do biegu o brązowy medal;*

 - *w ""meczu"" o brązowy medal i finale, kto pierwszy wygra dwa wyścigi, wygrywa pojedynek w parze.*

*Tu kończy się konkurencja.*

 - Mateusz Rudyk:
    - ćwierćfinał: 0:2, rywal: Harry Lavreysen (Holandia);
    - bieg o miejsca 5.-8.: 1. miejsce (po karnym przesunięciu dwóch gości, co go wyprzedzili na mecie, na koniec stawki);
    - ostatecznie: **5.** miejsce.

Lavreysen był zwycięzcą kwalifikacji i rekordzistą świata (choć nie pamiętam zawodów w kolarstwie torowym bez rekordów świata badających kilka razy w jedną rundę, więc według mnie posiadanie WR gówno znaczy, poza faktem bycia najszybszym w kwalifikacjach). więc Rudyk nie miał za bardzo szans w ćwierćfinale. 5. miejsce należy zatem uznać za wielki sukces, nawet jeżeli było zdobyte częściowo poza torem (choć z drugiej strony, przeciwnicy popełnili błędy za które zostali ukarani na torze, więc może to wciąż wynik 100% zdobyty na torze).

**Omnium, mężczyźni**

*Składa się z scratchu, wyścigu tempowego, wyścigu eliminacyjnego i wyścigu punktowego.*

*Scratch: NIE.*

*Wyścig tempowy: NIE.*

*Wyścig eliminacyjny: Po przejechaniu kilku okrążeń startowych, co 2 okrążenia jest eliminowany ostatni zawodnik w danym momencie, aż ostanie się tylko jeden. Ponieważ jest to wyścig od dupy strony, to i chyba ostatniego zawodnika mierzy się od dupy strony: (nie mam pewności, że to prawda) ważne nie jest, kto ostatni wpadł na linię mety, a kto przejechał całym obwodem tylnego koła linię mety.*

*Wyścig punktowy: NIE.*

 - Alan Banaszek:
    - scratch: 19. miejsce;
    - wyścig tempowy: 17. miejsce;
    - wyścig eliminacyjny: 9. miejsce;
    - wyścig punktowy: 11. miejsce;
    - omnium (całość): **18.** miejsce.

Mam nadzieję, że nikogo nie zgubiłem, bo znowu robię to stanowczo za późno, kiedy mój mózg przestaje wyrabiać.

#Plan występów w dniu 09.08.

Jeszcze dłuższe [źródło informacji](https://sport.tvp.pl/79249385/olimpiada-starty-polakow-w-piatek-982024-gdzie-ogladac-transmisje-na-zywo-z-io-paryz-terminarz) (edit: a tu [artykuł aktualizowany](https://sport.tvp.pl/79713062/olimpiada-2024-starty-medale-i-wyniki-polakow-na-igrzyskach-olimpijskich-9-sierpnia)).

*Pogrubienie* - konkurencje, gdzie jest bardzo blisko strefy medalowej (sporty ""versus"" - ćwierćfinał lub lepiej, sporty ""wieloosobowe"" - normalnie 8- zawodników w finale, w szczególnych przypadkach może być ich więcej, ale o niewiele). *Kursywa* - konkurencje, w których Polacy i Polki nie mają prawa startu w czasie pisania tego posta. Normalnym zachowaniem jest brak zmiany danych, ale czasami może dam jakąś aktualizację.

W niektórych przypadkach godziny są dokładne, w niektórych oznaczają tylko godziny startu całej sesji, więc radzę pilnować na bieżąco rzeczy jakie ktoś chce oglądać.

Poniżej jest cała seria finałów, gdzie byłoby cudem, jakby żadna polska osada nie awansowała do któregoś Finału A (ten o medale). ~~Więc to pogrubienie robi za takie zbiorcze.~~ (edit: dobra, mamy dwa finały z czterech, chociaż w kwestii osad wynik to 2/5, bo w kobiecych K2 mieliśmy dwie łódki, które odpadły)

18:09 – kolarstwo torowe, madison kobiet – finał (Daria Pikulik, Wiktoria Pikulik)

Jeżeli dobrze pamiętam, madison to najbardziej szalona konkurencja kolarstwa torowego, gdzie chyba w Tokio co chwilę ktoś leżał na torze, przez co zawody dostały określenie ""Death Race"" na subie olimpijskim.

Zostały tylko trzy dni, ale jeżeli strona Igrzysk mnie nie okłamuje (co robiła w przeszłości), to w niedzielę nie startuje żaden Polak ani Polka, więc zostały tylko dwa dni tych postów. *Moooooooooże* dodatkowo w niedzielę wieczór walnę jakiś pseudo-zbiorczy post, ale poza tabelkami nie spodziewajcie się niczego więcej niż ściany linków do starych postów. Głównie dlatego, że nawet jakbym okroił wszystko do czystych danych, to chyba wciąż bym się nie zmieścił w limicie 40k znaków.

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (08.08.)

#Lekkoatletyka

**Siedmiobój, kobiety**

 - Adrianna Sułek-Schubert:
    - 100 metrów przez płotki: 6. miejsce;
    - skok wzwyż: 8. miejsce;
    - pchnięcie kulą: 12. miejsce;
    - 200 metrów: 10. miejsce:
    - 4/7 konkurencji: 8. miejsce.

W piątek odbędą się skok w dal, rzut oszczepem i bieg na 800 metrów.

Nie ma za bardzo co oczekiwać walki o podium, bo Polka ma sporą stratę do Top 3, a do tego jest technika rzutu oszczepem (a szczególnie [bieg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCedsbbRkJA)) nie jest/była najlepsza, ale jeżeli skończy w Top 8 to wciąż to będzie sukces, szczególnie że Adrianna wróciła po przerwie macierzyńskiej.

**Pchnięcie kulą, kobiety**

 - Klaudia Kardasz:
    - kwalifikacje: **19.** miejsce.

**4x100 metrów, kobiety**

*Półfinał: awans - 3+2 do finału.*

 - Polska (Magdalena Niemczyk, Kryscina Cimanouska, Magdalena Stefanowicz, Ewa Swoboda):
    - półfinał: **5.** miejsce w biegu. Brak awansu z czasem.

**800 metrów, mężczyźni**

*Repasaże: awans - 1+2 do półfinału.*

 - Mateusz Borkowski:
    - repasaże: **6.** miejsce w biegu.

**1500 metrów, kobiety**

*Półfinał: awans - 6+0 do finału.*

 - Klaudia Kazimierska:
    - półfinał: 5. miejsce w biegu.

 - Weronika Lizakowska:
    - półfinał: **7.** miejsce w biegu.

Obie Polki zasługują na brawa za swoje biegi, nawet jeżeli efekty były całkowicie odmienne. Klaudia pobiła swój rekord życiowy, zapewniając sobie miejsce w finale, a Weronika ustanowiła nowy rekord Polski, ale niestety rywalki w jej biegu były jeszcze szybsze (jej czas dałby jej zwycięstwo w biegu Klaudii).

#Kajakarstwo

**C1, 200 metrów, kobiety**

*Kwalifikacje: 2 najszybsze zawodniczki w biegu do półfinału, reszta do ćwierćfinału.*

*Ćwierćfinał: 2 najszybsze zawodniczki w biegu do półfinału.*

*Półfinał: 4 najszybsze zawodniczki w biegu do finału A, reszta do finału B.*

 - Dorota Borowska:
    - kwalifikacje: 1. miejsce w biegu.

 - Katarzyna Szperkiewicz:
    - kwalifikacje: 4. miejsce w biegu;
    - ćwierćfinał: **3.** miejsce w biegu.

**K4, 500 metrów, kobiety**

 - Karolina Naja, Anna Puławska, Adrianna Kąkol, Dominika Putto:
    - finał: **4.** miejsce.

No niestety, w tym roku nie udało się ""Atomówkom"" zdobyć medalu na Igrzyskach. Przy czym ta nazwa chyba obowiązuje tylko osadę czteroosobową, bo 3 z 4 pań będą jeszcze startować w innych konkurencjach.

#Pięciobój nowoczesny

*W tym roku jeździectwo (a dokładniej skoki przez przeszkody) jest jeszcze częścią pięcioboju nowoczesnego, ale chyba od następnych Igrzysk nastąpi już zmiana na taki pseudo-Ninja Warrior tor.*

*Dziś odbyła się runda rankingowa szermierki, ale nie jestem pewien do czego jej wyniki będą użyte. W tym sensie, że najwyraźniej będą dwa półfinały przed finałami (piątek i sobota dla mężczyzn, sobota i niedziela dla kobiet), a o ile wszystkie pozostałe konkurencje (w tym runda bonusowa szermierki) odbywają się dla obu faz, widziałem tylko jedną rundę rankingową (która przydziela punkty do zawodów, a nie tylko ustala numery startowe).*

**Mężczyźni**

 - Łukasz Gutkowski:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 8. miejsce.

 - Kamil Kasperczak:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 9. miejsce.

**Kobiety**

 - Anna Maliszewska:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 20. miejsce.

 - Natalia Dominiak:
    - runda rankingowa szermierki: 31. miejsce.

#Zapasy

*Za jedną technikę można zdobyć od 1 do 5 punktów.*

*W stylu wolnym można atakować całe ciało rywala (no może poza głową, choć już szyi pewny nie jestem). W stylu dowolnym nie wolno atakować nóg.*

*W stylu klasycznym przewaga 8 punktów kończy walkę przed czasem. W stylu wolnym potrzeba aż 10 punktów przewagi by zakończyć walkę przed czasem.*

**Styl klasyczny, kategoria do 87 kilogramów, mężczyźni**

 - Arkadiusz Kułynycz:
    - repasaż: 3:1, rywal: Carlos Munoz Jaramillo (Kolumbia);
    - walka o brązowy medal: **1**:3, rywal: Zhan Beleniuk (Ukraina).

Mimo spotkania na swojej drodze mistrza świata (Turek z 1/8 finału) i mistrza olimpijskiego (Ukrainiec), Polak nie był wcale tak daleko od zdobycia brązowego medalu. No ale niestety skończyło się na niczym.

**Styl wolny,  kategoria do 57 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - Anhelina Łysak:
    - 1/8 finału: 13:16, rywalka: Alina Hrushyna Akobiia (Ukraina):
       - ćwierćfinał Aliny: 4:7, rywalka: Helen Louise Maroulis (USA).
    - pierwszy dzień: Polka odpadła z rywalizacji.

Pomiędzy dwoma czwartymi miejscami (choć można się kłócić, że w przypadku zapasów przegrany walki o brąz kończy na 5. miejscu, bo dwóch zawodników dostaje brązowy medal) to Anhelina zdobywa tytuł ""pokonanej przez liczbę 13"" (przy czym oryginalnie myślałem tylko o 13. dniu Igrzysk. Fakt że zdobyła 13 punktów jest bonusem). Bo gdyby punktowanie walk (a szczególnie ""wyższości zawodnika"") była taka sama w stylu wolnym jak w stylu klasycznym, to reprezentantka Polski wygrałaby przed czasem, gdyż w pewnym momencie prowadziła ośmioma punktami, 13:5. Ale niestety osłabła ona z sił, gdy nowe wstąpiły w Ukrainkę i była ona w stanie odrobić tę wielką stratę. 

#Żeglarstwo

CUD SIĘ STAŁ. Możliwym było odbycie zawodów żeglarskich dzisiaj. Wciąż z problemami, ale się ścigali.

**Formuła Kite, kobiety**

*Dobra, ogarnąłem jak działa faza finałowa.*

*Zawodniczki z miejsc od trzeciego do dziesiątego z fazy klasyfikacyjnej przechodzą do półfinałów, gdzie dzieli się je na dwie grupy (pewnie w schemacie, że miejsca 3-4 trafiają do różnych grup, tak jak miejsca 5-6, 7-8 i 9-10). Półfinały odbywają się na zasadzie ""pierwszy, kto wygra 3 wyścigi, przechodzi do finału"", przy czym zawodnicy z miejsc 3-4 dostają ""dwa darmowe zwycięstwa"", a zawodnicy z miejsc 5-6 jedno. Co oznacza, że o ile Polka musiałaby wygrać 3 wyścigi żeby awansować, to Holenderce, która weszła do półfinału z miejsc 3-4 wystarczyło wygrać jeden wyścig, by wygrać półfinał, co też uczyniła. Pozostałe miejsca są decydowane według tego, kto wygrał więcej biegów (licząc darmowe), a w przypadku dalszego remisu, liczy się punkty zdobyte w biegach (im mniej tym lepiej).*

*Zawodniczki z miejsc pierwszego i drugiego z fazy klasyfikacyjnej przechodzą bezpośrednio do finału. Zwyciężczyni fazy klasyfikacyjnej dostaje dwie darmowe wygrane, zawodniczka z drugiego miejsca jedną, a zawodniczki które awansowały z półfinałów zero. I znowu ścigami się do 3 zwycięstw, a reszta miejsc jest obstawiona według tego samego schematu co półfinał.*

 - Julia Damasiewicz:
    - półfinał: **3. miejsce** w grupie.

#Kolarstwo torowe

*Jeżeli myśleliście, że żeglarstwo ma dziwne zasady, szczególnie Formuła Kite, to przedstawiam wam króla pojebanych konkurencji - kolarstwo torowe, gdzie [konkurencja bazująca na grze hazardowej](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolarstwo_torowe#Keirin) jest potencjalnie najprostszą, najnormalniejszą dyscypliną.*

**Sprint, mężczyźni**

*Zawodnicy pokonują 3 okrążenia. Czas jest mierzony tylko na ostatnim. Przed każdą rundą poza kwalifikacjami losowana jest kolejność zawodników, którą muszą zachować przez pierwsze pół okrążenia. Potem mogą robić wszystko, włącznie ze stójką na torze, by przeciwnik musiał cię wyprzedzić, chyba że sam stanie w miejscu (przy czym chyba nie można dotknąć stopą toru).*

*Jak skomplikować prostą dyscyplinę, gdzie można kazać dwóm zawodnikom walczyć przeciwko sobie (bo po prostu jazda na czas, jak choćby w kolarstwie szosowym to już w ogóle byłoby zbyt proste)? Otóż tak:*

 - *w sesji kwalifikacyjnej/próbie czasowej 30 zawodników jedzie samotnie, by ustalić jak najlepszy czas. 24 zawodników przechodzi dalej;*

 - *w 1/32 finału 24 zawodników startuje w parach bazujących na miejscach zajętych w próbie czasowej (1. z 24., 2. z 23., itd.). Wygrani biegu przechodzą do 1/16 finału, przegrani przechodzą do repasażu/repesażu (z oryginalnego języka, francuskiego, powinno się mówić/pisać repEsaż, ale w polskim obie formy są poprawne) 1/32 finału;*

 - *w repesażu 1/32 finału 12 zawodników startuje w 4 biegach po 3 zawodników. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do 1/16 finału, przegrani odpadają;*

 - *w 1/16 finału 16 zawodników (w normalnej 1/16 finału normalnego systemu pucharowego 1vs1 startuje 32 zawodników/drużyn) startuje w parach, które nie jestem do końca pewien jak są stworzone (nie widzę schematu między jakimkolwiek wyścigiem zawierającym zawodników, którzy przeszli repasaże, a parami tej rundy, a strona Olimpiady nie mówi takich rzeczy). Zwycięzcy biegu przechodzą do 1/8 finału, przegrani przechodzą do repesaży 1/16 finału;*

 - *w repesażu 1/16 finału 8 zawodników startuje w 4 biegach po 2 zawodników. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do 1/8 finału, przegrani odpadają;*

 - *w 1/8 finału 12 zawodników startuje w parach. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do ćwierćfinału, przegrani do, zgadliście, repesaży 1/8 finału;*

 - *w repesażu 1/8 finału 6 zawodników startuje w 2 biegach po 3 zawodników. Zwycięzcy przechodzą do ćwierćfinału, przegrani odpadają;*

*Tutaj kończy się dzień pierwszy zawodów.*

 - *w ćwierćfinale 8 zawodników startuje w parach. Kto pierwszy wygra dwa wyścigi w parze przechodzi do półfinału, przegrany przechodzi do wyścigu o miejsca 5.-8.;*

 - *w biegu o miejsca 5.-8. 4 zawodników startuje w jednym biegu. Kto pierwszy dojedzie do mety, ten najlepszy (czyli na 5. miejscu);*

*Tutaj kończy się dzień drugi zawodów. Choć w przypadku kobiet ich bieg o miejsca 5.-8. jest zaplanowany na trzeci dzień.*
 
 - *w półfinale 4 zawodników startuje w parach. Kto pierwszy wygra dwa wyścigi w parze przechodzi do finału. Kto przegra przechodzi do biegu o brązowy medal;*

 - *w ""meczu"" o brązowy medal i finale, kto pierwszy wygra dwa wyścigi, wygrywa pojedynek w parze.*

*Tu kończy się konkurencja.*

 - Mateusz Rudyk:
    - ćwierćfinał: 0:2, rywal: Harry Lavreysen (Holandia);
    - bieg o miejsca 5.-8.: 1. miejsce (po karnym przesunięciu dwóch gości, co go wyprzedzili na mecie, na koniec stawki);
    - ostatecznie: **5.** miejsce.

Lavreysen był zwycięzcą kwalifikacji i rekordzistą świata (choć nie pamiętam zawodów w kolarstwie torowym bez rekordów świata badających kilka razy w jedną rundę, więc według mnie posiadanie WR gówno znaczy, poza faktem bycia najszybszym w kwalifikacjach). więc Rudyk nie miał za bardzo szans w ćwierćfinale. 5. miejsce należy zatem uznać za wielki sukces, nawet jeżeli było zdobyte częściowo poza torem (choć z drugiej strony, przeciwnicy popełnili błędy za które zostali ukarani na torze, więc może to wciąż wynik 100% zdobyty na torze).

**Omnium, mężczyźni**

*Składa się z scratchu, wyścigu tempowego, wyścigu eliminacyjnego i wyścigu punktowego.*

*Scratch: NIE.*

*Wyścig tempowy: NIE.*

*Wyścig eliminacyjny: Po przejechaniu kilku okrążeń startowych, co 2 okrążenia jest eliminowany ostatni zawodnik w danym momencie, aż ostanie się tylko jeden. Ponieważ jest to wyścig od dupy strony, to i chyba ostatniego zawodnika mierzy się od dupy strony: (nie mam pewności, że to prawda) ważne nie jest, kto ostatni wpadł na linię mety, a kto przejechał całym obwodem tylnego koła linię mety.*

*Wyścig punktowy: NIE.*

 - Alan Banaszek:
    - scratch: 19. miejsce;
    - wyścig tempowy: 17. miejsce;
    - wyścig eliminacyjny: 9. miejsce;
    - wyścig punktowy: 11. miejsce;
    - omnium (całość): **18.** miejsce.

Igrzyska Olimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 10.08 (sobota) | Plan startów 11.08 (niedziela),"Piętnasty dzień igrzysk za nami. Ostatni pełny, ale zanim zacznie się ceremonia zamknięcia (w sumie była jakaś mowa/jakieś przecieki o tym, że znowu dadzą pokaz na rzecze, czy może teraz będzie ""spokojnie"" na stadionie?) czeka nas jutro sporo finałów i kilka startów Polaków.

Niby zdobyliśmy dziś dwa medale, ale ten dzień należał raczej do gatunku tych smutnych. Nasi dzisiejsi finaliści, którzy do finałów zakwalifikowali się już kilka dni temu, nie mieli za bardzo szans (Francja to taki zespół, który z łatwością pokonuje Polaków jak im wychodzi sporo rzeczy, a dzisiaj wychodziło im wszystko: ataki, bloki, serwisy i obrony; a Tajwanka wykorzystała fakt, że jest ~10 centymetrów wyższa od Polki i ma większy zasięg ramion, więc zanim Polka mogła ją sięgnąć to dostawała gonga w kontrze), a w pozostałych konkurencjach zawodnicy albo spisali się na swoim poziomie, który był za słaby na przeciwników, albo spisali się poniżej swojego potencjału.

Jeżeli jutro nie zdobędziemy jakiś medali z zaskoczenia (i to chyba przynajmniej srebrnych), to w kwestii Igrzysk Letnich, po wykluczeniu zbojkotowanych Igrzysk w 1984, to będą to chyba najgorszy występ od 1952 roku.

Zapewne jedynym plusem kontuzji Bieńka jest to, że Bołądź, będący rezerwą medyczną, wystąpił w meczu na igrzyskach, dzięki czemu zapewnił sobie ""dostęp"" do medalu olimpijskiego.

Bo na przykład francuski zawodnik nie dość, że nie dostał medalu, to nawet nie chcieli go wpuścić na podium turnieju, bo z punktu widzenia przepisów IOC nie był członkiem drużyny, chociaż chyba wszystkie zespoły twierdziły, że limit 12 zawodników jest więcej niż głupi (bo chyba w IOC nikt nie zauważył, że chociaż na boisku jest jednocześnie 6 zawodników, to wyjściowy skład zawiera 7). Ale reprezentacja Francji się postawiła i dostaliśmy kuriozalny obrazek zawodnika stojącego na pierwszym miejscu podium bez medalu.

A jako informacja końcowa w tej fazie posta - planuję post podsumowująco-dyskusyjny w przyszłym tygodniu (mam nadzieję, że go wypuszczę do 23:59:59 we wtorek), w którym rzucę kilka haseł, dodatkowe tabelki i link do angielskiej Wikipedii, bo mają tam dobrze zorganizowane dane na temat występów.

------------------------------------------------

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (10.08.)

#Skoki do wody

**Wieża, 10 metrów, mężczyźni**

*W półfinale startuje 18 zawodników. Najlepsza 12 awansuje do finału.*

*Zawodnicy oddają 6 skoków, po jednym z każdej z 6 grup skoków (w przypadku trampoliny nie oddaje się skoków ze stania na rękach, więc tam oddaje się 2 skoki z jednej z pozostałych grup). Więcej na ten temat w [części D 1.5 tego pliku](https://www.polswim.pl/sites/default/files/przepisy_ogolne.pdf).*

 - Robert Łukaszewicz:
    - półfinał: **14.** miejsce.

#Kajakarstwo

**K1, 500 metrów, kobiety**

*Cztery półfinały po 8 zawodniczek. Pierwsza dwójka w biegu awansuje do Finału A (miejsca 1.-8.), druga dwójka do Finału B (miejsca 9.-16.), trzecia dwójka do Finału C (miejsca 17.-24.), ostatnia dwójka odpada z rywalizacji.*

 - Dominika Putto:
    - półfinał: 5. miejsce w biegu;
    - finał C: 2. miejsce;
    - ostatecznie: **18.** miejsce.

**C1, 200 metrów, kobiety**

*Dwa półfinały po 8 zawodniczek. Pierwsze 4 w biegu awansuje do Finału A, reszta do Finału B.*

 - Dorota Borowska:
    - półfinał: 6. miejsce w biegu;
    - finał B: 2. miejsce w biegu;
    - ostatecznie: **10.** miejsce.

To pierwsze Igrzyska na których byliśmy od 1980 roku, gdzie nie zdobyliśmy medalu w kajakarstwie **NIE**górskim (a przynajmniej mam nadzieję, że to znaczy to co myślę, że to znaczy (w sensie, w 1980 nie zdobyliśmy medalu, w 1984 nas nie było, a od 1988 do 2020 zawsze był medal)).

#Zapasy

*W stylu wolnym można atakować całe ciało przeciwnika, a karą za pasywność jest wymóg wykonania akcji w ciągu 30 sekund albo przeciwnik dostanie punkt. W stylu klasycznym (Greko-Romańskim) można atakować jedynie powyżej (chyba) pasa (ogólnie, tu nóg nie wolno), a karą za pasywność jest położenie się na środku maty brzuchem do spodu, po czym przeciwnik ustawia się nad tobą i może robić z tobą co chce, gdy ty albo musisz uciec za pole walki (jedyny moment, kiedy opuszczenie pola walki nie wiąże się z punktem dla przeciwnika), albo jakoś wstać i powrócić do pozycji ""normalnej.*

**Kategoria do 125 kilogramów, styl wolny, mężczyźni**

 - Robert Baran:
    - repasaż: 3:0, rywal: Oleksandr Khotsianivskyi (Ukraina);
    - walka o brązowy medal: **3**:9, rywal: Giorgi Meshvildishvili (Azerbejdżan).

**Kategoria do 97 kilogramów, styl wolny, mężczyźni**

 - Zbigniew Baranowski:
    - 1/8 finału: 8:2, rywal: Radu Lefter (Mołdawia);
    - ćwierćfinał: 2:7, rywal: Magomedkhan Magomedov (Azerbejdżan):
       - półfinał rywala: 0:5, rywal: Givi Matcharashvili (Gruzja).
    - pierwszy dzień: Polak **odpadł** z rywalizacji.

Niby powinny to być spodziewane rezultaty, bo przeważnie rywale z dalszej części turnieju są utytułowani i to oni są przeważnie faworytami walk z Polakami, ale ten schemat ""1 walka wygrana, 1 walka przegrana"" już się robi cholernie nudny. Przy czym to dotyczy większości sportów walki, a nie tylko zapasów.

#Siatkówka

**Turniej halowy, mężczyźni**

 - **Polska 🥈**:
    - finał: **0**:3 (19:25, 20:25, 23:25), rywal: Francja.

Chyba w temacie o medalu ktoś mi wysłał odpowiedź na moje zapytanie, że w ostatnich latach (chyba od 2020) mamy bilans 5:5 z Francuzami w meczach (chyba licząc ten). Więc wcale nie są tacy niepokonani, ale akurat siatkarze przyzwyczaili nas do znacznie lepszego bilansu wygranych meczy niż 50%, więc twierdzę, że Francja to jedna z pięt achillesowych Polski, gdzie jeżeli oni są w formie, to trzeba bać się o wynik (kiedyś takim krajem była Brazylia - jak kojarzę dobrze statystyki meczów pomiędzy nami w ostatniej Lidze Narodów to chyba było 26:16 dla Brazylii. A każdy chyba powie, że ostatnio często z nimi wygrywamy, więc ta statystyka musiała być jeszcze gorsza w przeszłości; a ostatnimi latami Słowenia to też był taki zespół, którego woleliśmy nie trafiać).

A jak rozpoznać, że Francuzi są w formie? Gdy komentatorzy Polsat Sport (wypożyczeni do Eurosportu na Igrzyska) co chwilą krzyczą ""N'GAPETH!!!"". Przyrzekam, jak on gra dobrze (gdzie to jest eufemizm, po prostu nie mogę wymyślić mocnego słowa, które jest poniżej doskonale, bo chyba miał troszeczkę błędów), to doskonale (a tu już się nie boję tego powiedzieć) gra cała Francja. Dodać do tego naszych, którzy podejmują podejrzane decyzje (ale czy to wina ich, czy doskonałej obrony Francuzów?), no i otrzymujemy taki efekt końcowy.

No ale wciąż, po serii 5 porażek w półfinałach na Igrzyskach, srebro JEST wielkim sukcesem, no bo do cholery, to oznacza że jesteśmy drugą najlepszą drużyną. Niechaj chłopaki wciąż tak grają w następnych latach.

#Pięciobój nowoczesny

*9 najlepszych zawodników z obu półfinałów awansują do finału. Zawody są tak zorganizowane, że kto pierwszy ukończy ostatnią konkurencję, laser run (kombinacja biegu przełajowego i strzelectwa), jest zwycięzcą zawodów.*

**Kobiety**

 - Anna Maliszewska:
    - półfinał: **11.** miejsce w swoim półfinale.

 - Natalia Dominiak:
    - półfinał: **13.** miejsce w swoim półfinale.

**Mężczyźni**

 - Łukasz Gutkowski:
    - finał: **15.** miejsce.

#Podnoszenie ciężarów

*Najpierw mamy trzy podejścia w rwaniu (sztangę trzeba podnieść od razu nad głowę). Po chwili przerwy mamy trzy podejścia w podrzucie (sztangę najpierw można podnieść na okolice obojczyka i sobie ją tam chwile przetrzymać, zanim podniesiemy ją nad głowę). Na Igrzyskach Olimpijskich medale dostaje się jedynie za sumę wyników w tych dwóch konkurencjach.""

**Kategoria do 81 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - Weronika Zielińska:
    - rwanie: nieklasyfikowana;
    - podrzut: niedopuszczona do startu;
    - ostateczny wynik: ***technicznie brak***.

Taaa... Nie jestem do końca pewien co się odwaliło w polskiej sztandze, ale skończyliśmy z tylko jedną zawodniczką na Igrzyskach. Przy czym to nie była jednak jakaś wycieczka (coś w stylu Professor Raygun, najnowszego mema tych Igrzysk), bo dostała się tam za wystarczająco wysoką pozycję w rankingu światowym. Niestety, najwyraźniej team zadysponował zbyt ciężki ciężar na pierwszą próbę, pewnie marząc o walce o wysokie miejsca, i Polka spaliła wszystkie trzy podejścia w rwaniu. 

#Kolarstwo torowe

**Keirin, mężczyźni**

*Najpierw zawodnicy pokonują trzy okrążenia za derną, która jedzie z ustaloną prędkością, która chyba rośnie co okrążenie. Derna musi być w całości przed zawodnikami dopóki nie zjedzie w pełni z toru. Przez następne trzy okrążenia zawodnicy ścigają się do mety.*

*Pierwsza runda: dwóch pierwszych zawodników (zawsze po zaaplikowaniu wszystkich kar) awansuje do ćwierćfinału, reszta do repasaży.*

*Repasaże: dwóch pierwszych zawodników awansuje do ćwierćfinału.*

*Ćwierćfinału: czterech pierwszych zawodników awansuje do półfinału.*

*Półfinał: trzech pierwszych zawodników awansuje do finału.*

*Finał: kto ""uczciwie"" pierwszy, ten lepszy.*

 - Mateusz Rudyk:
    - pierwsza runda: 2. miejsce w biegu.

Rudyk awansował bezpośrednio do ćwierćfinału, który odbędzie się jutro.
    
#Lekkoatletyka,

**Rzut oszczepem, kobiety**

 - Maria Andrejczyk:
    - finał: **8.** miejsce.

Najbardziej boli fakt, że jej wynik z eliminacji (jedyny rzut jaki oddała, bo spełniła od razu minimum kwalifikacyjne) dałby jej 2. miejsce. Na drugim miejscu boleści jest fakt, że jej pierwszy rzut był najlepszy, a po drugim rzucie chyba przestała przekraczać granicę 60 metrów (licząc spalone próby, bo paliła je z powodu bycia chujowymi wynikami). Na trzecim miejscu jest słuchanie na Maxie transmisji tylko z rzutu oszczepem (bo nie ufałem Eurosportowi, że będzie przełączać na próby Polki z transmisji międzynarodowej), w języku angielskim, bo co próbę Polki to komentatorzy wytykali jej masę błędów, i dziwili się, że wciąż je popełnia.

**1500 metrów, kobiety**

 - Klaudia Kazimierska:
    - finał: **10.** miejsce.

Nawet bieg po nowy rekord Polski (zakładając typowe bicie o 1 sekundę maks, a nie jakiś cud i poprawę o 5+ sekund) czasowo wciąż byłby daleko od zwyciężczyń biegu. Przynajmniej wpadł kolejny rekord życiowy i trafienie z formą na imprezę docelową, czego nie można powiedzieć o wszystkich zawodnikach i zawodniczkach.

#Boks

**Kategoria do 57 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - **Julia Szeremeta 🥈**:
    - finał: **0**:5 (27:30, 27:30, 27:30, 27:30, 27:30), rywalka: Lin Yu-Ting (Tajwan),

Na początku chcę zaznaczyć, że walki lekkich amatorek ma się nijak do walk ciężkich profesjonalistów. To wszystko co mogę powiedzieć jako ktoś, kto nie zna się na boksie. Byłbym wdzięczny jakby resztę komentarza zweryfikował ktoś, kto się na tym zna, a przynajmniej ogląda na tyle, by móc uważać, że się zna. Bo to jest co najwyżej moja własna opinia, że tutaj jeżeli zawodnik ma tak dużą przewagę wzrostu i zasięgu ramion, to walka jest jego do przegrania. Wystarczy trzymać dystans; trafiać przeciwnika, który próbuje cię zaatakować; przechodzić do klinczu, albo się wycofywać po trafieniu; i powtarzać to w kółko, i przeciwnik nie ma co zrobić, szczególnie jak nie ma sił by cię znokautować, jak jakimś cudem cię trafi.

To o czym się mogę wypowiadać z pewnością to to, że to pierwszy medal w boksie za mojego życia, pierwszy medal od 1992 roku, pierwszy finał of 1980 i najlepszy medal olimpijski jaki zdobyliśmy na kortach Rolanda Garrosa (nie wiem czy istnieją u nas takie rzeczy jak ""[quizy pubowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_quiz)"", ale to byłaby doskonała ciekawostka do sekcji sportowej).

20:25 - ceremonia zamknięcia Igrzysk Olimpijskich

A już na sam koniec wspomnę, że od 28 sierpnia do 8 września odbywać się będą Igrzyska Paraolimpijskie. Kadra w tym roku chyba będzie o wiele mniejsza niż w latach poprzednich, ale wciąż nasi paraolimpijczycy powinni przywieźć do kraju worek medali.",Polska,2024-08-10 22:48:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/1ep5lay/igrzyska_olimpijskie_wyniki_polaków_i_polek_1008/,"Igrzyska Olimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 10.08 (sobota) | Plan startów 11.08 (niedziela) Piętnasty dzień igrzysk za nami.

A jako informacja końcowa w tej fazie posta - planuję post podsumowująco-dyskusyjny w przyszłym tygodniu (mam nadzieję, że go wypuszczę do 23:59:59 we wtorek), w którym rzucę kilka haseł, dodatkowe tabelki i link do angielskiej Wikipedii, bo mają tam dobrze zorganizowane dane na temat występów.

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (10.08.)

#Skoki do wody

**Wieża, 10 metrów, mężczyźni**

*W półfinale startuje 18 zawodników. Najlepsza 12 awansuje do finału.*

*Zawodnicy oddają 6 skoków, po jednym z każdej z 6 grup skoków (w przypadku trampoliny nie oddaje się skoków ze stania na rękach, więc tam oddaje się 2 skoki z jednej z pozostałych grup). Więcej na ten temat w [części D 1.5 tego pliku](https://www.polswim.pl/sites/default/files/przepisy_ogolne.pdf).*

 - Robert Łukaszewicz:
    - półfinał: **14.** miejsce.

#Kajakarstwo

**K1, 500 metrów, kobiety**

*Cztery półfinały po 8 zawodniczek. Pierwsza dwójka w biegu awansuje do Finału A (miejsca 1.-8.), druga dwójka do Finału B (miejsca 9.-16.), trzecia dwójka do Finału C (miejsca 17.-24.), ostatnia dwójka odpada z rywalizacji.*

 - Dominika Putto:
    - półfinał: 5. miejsce w biegu;
    - finał C: 2. miejsce;
    - ostatecznie: **18.** miejsce.

**C1, 200 metrów, kobiety**

*Dwa półfinały po 8 zawodniczek. Pierwsze 4 w biegu awansuje do Finału A, reszta do Finału B.*

 - Dorota Borowska:
    - półfinał: 6. miejsce w biegu;
    - finał B: 2. miejsce w biegu;
    - ostatecznie: **10.** miejsce.

To pierwsze Igrzyska na których byliśmy od 1980 roku, gdzie nie zdobyliśmy medalu w kajakarstwie **NIE**górskim (a przynajmniej mam nadzieję, że to znaczy to co myślę, że to znaczy (w sensie, w 1980 nie zdobyliśmy medalu, w 1984 nas nie było, a od 1988 do 2020 zawsze był medal)).

#Zapasy

*W stylu wolnym można atakować całe ciało przeciwnika, a karą za pasywność jest wymóg wykonania akcji w ciągu 30 sekund albo przeciwnik dostanie punkt. W stylu klasycznym (Greko-Romańskim) można atakować jedynie powyżej (chyba) pasa (ogólnie, tu nóg nie wolno), a karą za pasywność jest położenie się na środku maty brzuchem do spodu, po czym przeciwnik ustawia się nad tobą i może robić z tobą co chce, gdy ty albo musisz uciec za pole walki (jedyny moment, kiedy opuszczenie pola walki nie wiąże się z punktem dla przeciwnika), albo jakoś wstać i powrócić do pozycji ""normalnej.*

**Kategoria do 125 kilogramów, styl wolny, mężczyźni**

 - Robert Baran:
    - repasaż: 3:0, rywal: Oleksandr Khotsianivskyi (Ukraina);
    - walka o brązowy medal: **3**:9, rywal: Giorgi Meshvildishvili (Azerbejdżan).

**Kategoria do 97 kilogramów, styl wolny, mężczyźni**

 - Zbigniew Baranowski:
    - 1/8 finału: 8:2, rywal: Radu Lefter (Mołdawia);
    - ćwierćfinał: 2:7, rywal: Magomedkhan Magomedov (Azerbejdżan):
       - półfinał rywala: 0:5, rywal: Givi Matcharashvili (Gruzja).
    - pierwszy dzień: Polak **odpadł** z rywalizacji.

Niby powinny to być spodziewane rezultaty, bo przeważnie rywale z dalszej części turnieju są utytułowani i to oni są przeważnie faworytami walk z Polakami, ale ten schemat ""1 walka wygrana, 1 walka przegrana"" już się robi cholernie nudny. Przy czym to dotyczy większości sportów walki, a nie tylko zapasów.

#Siatkówka

**Turniej halowy, mężczyźni**

 - **Polska 🥈**:
    - finał: **0**:3 (19:25, 20:25, 23:25), rywal: Francja.

Chyba w temacie o medalu ktoś mi wysłał odpowiedź na moje zapytanie, że w ostatnich latach (chyba od 2020) mamy bilans 5:5 z Francuzami w meczach (chyba licząc ten). Więc wcale nie są tacy niepokonani, ale akurat siatkarze przyzwyczaili nas do znacznie lepszego bilansu wygranych meczy niż 50%, więc twierdzę, że Francja to jedna z pięt achillesowych Polski, gdzie jeżeli oni są w formie, to trzeba bać się o wynik (kiedyś takim krajem była Brazylia - jak kojarzę dobrze statystyki meczów pomiędzy nami w ostatniej Lidze Narodów to chyba było 26:16 dla Brazylii. A każdy chyba powie, że ostatnio często z nimi wygrywamy, więc ta statystyka musiała być jeszcze gorsza w przeszłości; a ostatnimi latami Słowenia to też był taki zespół, którego woleliśmy nie trafiać).

A jak rozpoznać, że Francuzi są w formie? Gdy komentatorzy Polsat Sport (wypożyczeni do Eurosportu na Igrzyska) co chwilą krzyczą ""N'GAPETH!!!"". Przyrzekam, jak on gra dobrze (gdzie to jest eufemizm, po prostu nie mogę wymyślić mocnego słowa, które jest poniżej doskonale, bo chyba miał troszeczkę błędów), to doskonale (a tu już się nie boję tego powiedzieć) gra cała Francja. Dodać do tego naszych, którzy podejmują podejrzane decyzje (ale czy to wina ich, czy doskonałej obrony Francuzów?), no i otrzymujemy taki efekt końcowy.

No ale wciąż, po serii 5 porażek w półfinałach na Igrzyskach, srebro JEST wielkim sukcesem, no bo do cholery, to oznacza że jesteśmy drugą najlepszą drużyną. Niechaj chłopaki wciąż tak grają w następnych latach.

#Pięciobój nowoczesny

*9 najlepszych zawodników z obu półfinałów awansują do finału. Zawody są tak zorganizowane, że kto pierwszy ukończy ostatnią konkurencję, laser run (kombinacja biegu przełajowego i strzelectwa), jest zwycięzcą zawodów.*

**Kobiety**

 - Anna Maliszewska:
    - półfinał: **11.** miejsce w swoim półfinale.

 - Natalia Dominiak:
    - półfinał: **13.** miejsce w swoim półfinale.

**Mężczyźni**

 - Łukasz Gutkowski:
    - finał: **15.** miejsce.

#Podnoszenie ciężarów

*Najpierw mamy trzy podejścia w rwaniu (sztangę trzeba podnieść od razu nad głowę). Po chwili przerwy mamy trzy podejścia w podrzucie (sztangę najpierw można podnieść na okolice obojczyka i sobie ją tam chwile przetrzymać, zanim podniesiemy ją nad głowę). Na Igrzyskach Olimpijskich medale dostaje się jedynie za sumę wyników w tych dwóch konkurencjach.""

**Kategoria do 81 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - Weronika Zielińska:
    - rwanie: nieklasyfikowana;
    - podrzut: niedopuszczona do startu;
    - ostateczny wynik: ***technicznie brak***.

Taaa... Nie jestem do końca pewien co się odwaliło w polskiej sztandze, ale skończyliśmy z tylko jedną zawodniczką na Igrzyskach. Przy czym to nie była jednak jakaś wycieczka (coś w stylu Professor Raygun, najnowszego mema tych Igrzysk), bo dostała się tam za wystarczająco wysoką pozycję w rankingu światowym. Niestety, najwyraźniej team zadysponował zbyt ciężki ciężar na pierwszą próbę, pewnie marząc o walce o wysokie miejsca, i Polka spaliła wszystkie trzy podejścia w rwaniu. 

#Kolarstwo torowe

**Keirin, mężczyźni**

*Najpierw zawodnicy pokonują trzy okrążenia za derną, która jedzie z ustaloną prędkością, która chyba rośnie co okrążenie. Derna musi być w całości przed zawodnikami dopóki nie zjedzie w pełni z toru. Przez następne trzy okrążenia zawodnicy ścigają się do mety.*

*Pierwsza runda: dwóch pierwszych zawodników (zawsze po zaaplikowaniu wszystkich kar) awansuje do ćwierćfinału, reszta do repasaży.*

*Repasaże: dwóch pierwszych zawodników awansuje do ćwierćfinału.*

*Ćwierćfinału: czterech pierwszych zawodników awansuje do półfinału.*

*Półfinał: trzech pierwszych zawodników awansuje do finału.*

*Finał: kto ""uczciwie"" pierwszy, ten lepszy.*

 - Mateusz Rudyk:
    - pierwsza runda: 2. miejsce w biegu.

Rudyk awansował bezpośrednio do ćwierćfinału, który odbędzie się jutro.
    
#Lekkoatletyka,

**Rzut oszczepem, kobiety**

 - Maria Andrejczyk:
    - finał: **8.** miejsce.

Najbardziej boli fakt, że jej wynik z eliminacji (jedyny rzut jaki oddała, bo spełniła od razu minimum kwalifikacyjne) dałby jej 2. miejsce. Na drugim miejscu boleści jest fakt, że jej pierwszy rzut był najlepszy, a po drugim rzucie chyba przestała przekraczać granicę 60 metrów (licząc spalone próby, bo paliła je z powodu bycia chujowymi wynikami). Na trzecim miejscu jest słuchanie na Maxie transmisji tylko z rzutu oszczepem (bo nie ufałem Eurosportowi, że będzie przełączać na próby Polki z transmisji międzynarodowej), w języku angielskim, bo co próbę Polki to komentatorzy wytykali jej masę błędów, i dziwili się, że wciąż je popełnia.

**1500 metrów, kobiety**

 - Klaudia Kazimierska:
    - finał: **10.** miejsce.

Nawet bieg po nowy rekord Polski (zakładając typowe bicie o 1 sekundę maks, a nie jakiś cud i poprawę o 5+ sekund) czasowo wciąż byłby daleko od zwyciężczyń biegu. Przynajmniej wpadł kolejny rekord życiowy i trafienie z formą na imprezę docelową, czego nie można powiedzieć o wszystkich zawodnikach i zawodniczkach.

#Boks

**Kategoria do 57 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - **Julia Szeremeta 🥈**:
    - finał: **0**:5 (27:30, 27:30, 27:30, 27:30, 27:30), rywalka: Lin Yu-Ting (Tajwan),

Na początku chcę zaznaczyć, że walki lekkich amatorek ma się nijak do walk ciężkich profesjonalistów. To wszystko co mogę powiedzieć jako ktoś, kto nie zna się na boksie. Byłbym wdzięczny jakby resztę komentarza zweryfikował ktoś, kto się na tym zna, a przynajmniej ogląda na tyle, by móc uważać, że się zna. Bo to jest co najwyżej moja własna opinia, że tutaj jeżeli zawodnik ma tak dużą przewagę wzrostu i zasięgu ramion, to walka jest jego do przegrania. Wystarczy trzymać dystans; trafiać przeciwnika, który próbuje cię zaatakować; przechodzić do klinczu, albo się wycofywać po trafieniu; i powtarzać to w kółko, i przeciwnik nie ma co zrobić, szczególnie jak nie ma sił by cię znokautować, jak jakimś cudem cię trafi.

To o czym się mogę wypowiadać z pewnością to to, że to pierwszy medal w boksie za mojego życia, pierwszy medal od 1992 roku, pierwszy finał of 1980 i najlepszy medal olimpijski jaki zdobyliśmy na kortach Rolanda Garrosa (nie wiem czy istnieją u nas takie rzeczy jak ""[quizy pubowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_quiz)"", ale to byłaby doskonała ciekawostka do sekcji sportowej).

Igrzyska Paraolimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 06.09. (piątek) | Plan startów 07.09. (sobota),"Dziewiąty dzień występów Polaków i Polek na Igrzyskach Paraolimpijskich za nami.

Kolejne medale, kolejne złota i kolejny, chyba już ostatni, ""zawieszony medal"" (bo jak kojarzę wyniki z poprzednich dni, to chyba dzisiaj startowała ostatnia tenisistka stołowa). Polski parasport paratenisem stołowym i paralekkoatletyką stoi, ale i inne konkurencje się dorzucają do worka medalowego, a kolejne stoją w pobliżu (na pewno boccia i podnoszenie ciężarów, a pewnie jeszcze coś innego zapominam).

Wczoraj ""nie miałem czasu"", więc dopiero dzisiaj rozwinę myśl ""*szczęście w sporcie*"" - temat z dość szerokim zakresem opinii, bo na jednym końcu ludzie będą mówić, że w sporcie nie ma szczęścia, i że wszystko zależy w 100% od sportowca; a na drugim będą ludzie wredni, twierdzący że wszystkie sukcesy i osiągnięcia zostały osiągnięte za pomocą tylko i wyłącznie szczęścia. Natomiast tutaj, zależnie od tego gdzie kto widzi środek, ""oświeceni centryści"" mogą mieć trochę racji - kwestią jest jak naprawdę wygląda to szczęście i w jakiej formie się objawia. Bo o ile ludzie normalnie myślą o szczęściu jako o czymś pozytywnym (w stylu na przykład ""O ja cię, właśnie znalazłem 200 złotych na ulicy""), to tutaj mówimy o ""szczęściu"" jako braku negatywnych zdarzeń, zgodnie z powiedzeniem że pech jednego to szczęście drugiego.

I tak jak wczoraj Rafał zdobył brązowy medal w wyścigu ze startu wspólnego z pomocą szczęścia w postaci braku własnych problemów, gdy przeciwnikom ""co chwilę"" coś się trafiało (od przebitych opon do rowerów rozpadających się w drobny mak po zderzeniu z barierką), tak dzisiaj to Patrycja i Katarzyna były ofiarami braku szczęścia, gdy ich łańcuch rozpadł się dosłownie na pierwszych 100 metrach wyścigu. A że tu nie ma wozów technicznych jak na normalnych wyścigach (nie mówiąc o tym, że gonienie reszty stawki jest chyba niemalże niemożliwe, bo wszyscy praktycznie cały czas jadą na >90%), to występ Polek zakończył się szybciej niż Aleksandrze Mirosław zajmuje wspięcie się na szczyt ścianki.

Przynajmniej klątwa chorążych nie działa na Paraolimpiadzie, do srebrnego medalu Lucyny Kordobys dzisiaj Maciej Lepiato dołożył brąz. Może tutaj klątwa ogranicza się do nie najlepszej transmisji zawodów (choć można się kłócić, że rzut kulą zawodników używających siedzisk jest ""trudno"" pokazać w ekscytujący sposób).

To uczucie, gdy człowiek musi napisać, że z 21 (22) medalami obecne Paraigrzyska są wciąż najgorszymi w historii Polski pod względem ilości, ale jeszcze dwa (jak się uprzeć to półtora) dni zawodów przed nami i najpewniej jeszcze poprawimy ten wynik (ścigamy Tokio z 24 medalami w sumie). Ale za to pod względem klasycznej tabeli medalowej w Paryżu jest już lepiej niż w Pekinie 2008, gdzie skończyliśmy ""tylko"" z 5 złotymi medalami.

Z jednej strony, chciałbym zobaczyć na żywo (w telewizji) występ chociaż w połowie tak dobry jak na [Paraolimpiadzie w 1980 roku](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polska_na_Letnich_Igrzyskach_Paraolimpijskich_1980). Z drugiej, jak sobie pomyślę, o robieniu tabelki na ~100 medali, to czuję jak bardzo by mi się nie chciało, przynajmniej w kwestii formatowania do którego nikt mnie nie zmusza. 

------------------------------------------------

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (06.09.)

#Parakolarstwo szosowe

**Wyścig ze startu wspólnego, mężczyźni, [kategoria B](https://lexi.global/sports/cycling-road/v-i)**:

 - Karol Kopicz, pilot Marcin Białobłocki:
    - wynik: **7.** miejsce.

**Wyścig ze startu wspólnego, mężczyźni, [kategoria B](https://lexi.global/sports/cycling-road/v-i)**:

 - Patrycja Kuter, pilot Katarzyna Kornasiewicz:
    - wynik: **DNF**

No niestety, nieważne jak bardzo zawodnik chce dobrze wystąpić, jeżeli los stwierdzi ""[NIE](https://i.redd.it/qnrxd1yxsma91.jpg)"", to nie ma bata.

#Parapływanie

**100 metrów stylem motylkowym, mężczyźni, [kategoria S9](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/freestyle-backstroke-butterfly/s9)**:

 - Igor Hrehorowicz:
    - kwalifikacje: **14.** miejsce.

**50 metrów stylem dowolnym, mężczyźni, [kategoria S3](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/freestyle-backstroke-butterfly/s3)**:

 - Krzysztof Lechniak:
    - kwalifikacje: **10.** miejsce.

**100 metrów stylem dowolnym, mężczyźni, [kategoria S8](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/freestyle-backstroke-butterfly/s8)**:

 - Michał Golus:
    - kwalifikacje: **14.** miejsce.
 
#Paratenis stołowy

**Turniej singlowy, kobiety, [kategoria WS9](https://lexi.global/sports/table-tennis/standing-tt9)**:

 - **Karolina Pęk** 🏅:
    - ćwierćfinał: 3:0 (11:6, 11:9, 12:10), rywalka: Mao Jingdian (Chiny).

Ciekawe czy w czasie powitania parasportowców na lotnisku w Warszawie, ktoś z kibiców lub reporterów się ""kapnął"", że jeszcze nie wszyscy dotarli do celu. Dorota czekała jeszcze na ceremonię medalową (finał był dopiero dzisiaj), a Karolina dopiero jutro zakończy turniej (wyjątkowo finał będzie tego samego dnia co półfinał).

A co do meczu to ciekawostka, do igrzysk w Tokio reprezentantka Chin startowała w kategorii [TT8](https://lexi.global/sports/table-tennis/standing-tt8). Więc w sumie muszę wspomnieć, że kategorie zawodników to nie jest coś ustalone w kamieniu - okresowo zawodnicy są badani i podlegają ocenie jak ich obecny stan i sprawność plasuje ich w ""skali niepełnosprawności"".

#Szermierka na wózkach

Polsat nie miał w planach transmisji z szermierki w ogóle, więc za to idzie duży minus (bo chyba jak w tej olimpijskiej, w tym sporcie mamy wiele szans na medale). Ale mały plus za to, że postanowili skołować jakikolwiek obraz z drugiego meczu o brązowy medal z udziałem reprezentanta, a dokładniej reprezentantki, Polski, przy czym był to obraz dość ""nieoficjalny"" (widok jakby z trybun, bez żadnych oficjalnych plansz, bo ich nie mogło być XD).

**Szpada indywidualnie, mężczyźni, [kategoria B](https://lexi.global/sports/wheelchair-fencing/epee-cat-b)**:

 - **Michał Dąbrowski** 🥉:
    - 1/8 finału: 15:5, rywal: Gianmarco Paolucci (Włochy);
    - ćwierćfinał: 15:5, rywal: Hu Daoliang (Chiny);
    - półfinał: 13:15, rywal: Dimitri Coutya (Wielka Brytania);
    - półfinał repasaży: 15:7, rywal: Jovane Guissone (Brazylia);
    - mecz o 3. miejsce: **15**:14, rywal: Zhang Jie (Chiny).

Spostrzegawczy ludzie mogą zauważyć, że w przeciwieństwie do szermierki pełnosprawnej, w szermierce na wózkach sporo zawodników startuje w kilku stylach broni. Co więcej, to był drugi pojedynek Michała i Gianmarco, po ćwierćfinale w szabli (tam było 15:4 dla Polaka).

Nie wspomniałem o tym poprzednim razem, bo nie byłem 100% pewien tej informacji, a przyznaję, że lekko zawiodłem i nie sprawdziłem informacji w internecie, ale teraz to zrobię. [Michał cierpi na nowotwór przewodów żółciowych wewnątrzwątrobowych](https://sport.tvp.pl/82117631/michal-dabrowski-walczy-z-nowotworem-trwa-zbiorka-srodkow-na-leczenie-wicemistrza-paralimpijskiego) i poza walką o medale toczy także walkę o swoje życie, w której te medale w sumie mogą mocno pomóc, bo i może liczyć na jakieś pieniądze za wyniki (choć podejrzewam, że znacznie więcej pieniędzy byłoby za sprzedanie medali niż dostanie z ministerstwa w nagrodę), i rozgłos spowodowany ich zdobyciem pewnie mocno pomoże w zbiórce pieniędzy jaką prowadzi (link do niej jest na dole artykułu na stronie Sport TVP).

    - 1/8 repasaży: **7**:15, rywal: Artem Manko (Ukraina).

**Szpada indywidualnie, mężczyźni, [kategoria A](https://lexi.global/sports/wheelchair-fencing/epee-cat-a)**:

    - ćwierćfinał: 13:15, rywalka: Gu Haiyan (Chiny);
    - 1/8 repasaży: 15:11, rywalka: Kinga Dróżdż (Polska);
    - ćwierćfinał repasaży: 15:12, rywalka: Yu Chuy Yee (Hong Kong);
    - półfinał repasaży: 15:8, rywalka: Amarilla Veres (Węgry);
    - mecz o 3. miejsce: **13**:15, rywalka: Gu Haiyan (Chiny).

No niestety, Chinka była dzisiaj nie do przejścia.

 - Kinga Dróżdż:
    - 1/16 finału: 15:9, rywalka: Baek Gyeong Hye (Korea Południowa);
    - 1/8 finału: 10:15, rywalka: Amarilla Veres (Węgry);
    - 1/16 repasaży: 15:14, rywalka: Zsuzsanna Krajnyak (Węgry);
    - 1/8 repasaży: **11**:15, rywalka: Marta Fidrych (Polska).

(piątek) | Plan startów 07.09. (sobota) Dziewiąty dzień występów Polaków i Polek na Igrzyskach Paraolimpijskich za nami.

Kolejne medale, kolejne złota i kolejny, chyba już ostatni, ""zawieszony medal"" (bo jak kojarzę wyniki z poprzednich dni, to chyba dzisiaj startowała ostatnia tenisistka stołowa). Polski parasport paratenisem stołowym i paralekkoatletyką stoi, ale i inne konkurencje się dorzucają do worka medalowego, a kolejne stoją w pobliżu (na pewno boccia i podnoszenie ciężarów, a pewnie jeszcze coś innego zapominam).

Wczoraj ""nie miałem czasu"", więc dopiero dzisiaj rozwinę myśl ""*szczęście w sporcie*"" - temat z dość szerokim zakresem opinii, bo na jednym końcu ludzie będą mówić, że w sporcie nie ma szczęścia, i że wszystko zależy w 100% od sportowca; a na drugim będą ludzie wredni, twierdzący że wszystkie sukcesy i osiągnięcia zostały osiągnięte za pomocą tylko i wyłącznie szczęścia. Natomiast tutaj, zależnie od tego gdzie kto widzi środek, ""oświeceni centryści"" mogą mieć trochę racji - kwestią jest jak naprawdę wygląda to szczęście i w jakiej formie się objawia. Bo o ile ludzie normalnie myślą o szczęściu jako o czymś pozytywnym (w stylu na przykład ""O ja cię, właśnie znalazłem 200 złotych na ulicy""), to tutaj mówimy o ""szczęściu"" jako braku negatywnych zdarzeń, zgodnie z powiedzeniem że pech jednego to szczęście drugiego.

I tak jak wczoraj Rafał zdobył brązowy medal w wyścigu ze startu wspólnego z pomocą szczęścia w postaci braku własnych problemów, gdy przeciwnikom ""co chwilę"" coś się trafiało (od przebitych opon do rowerów rozpadających się w drobny mak po zderzeniu z barierką), tak dzisiaj to Patrycja i Katarzyna były ofiarami braku szczęścia, gdy ich łańcuch rozpadł się dosłownie na pierwszych 100 metrach wyścigu. A że tu nie ma wozów technicznych jak na normalnych wyścigach (nie mówiąc o tym, że gonienie reszty stawki jest chyba niemalże niemożliwe, bo wszyscy praktycznie cały czas jadą na >90%), to występ Polek zakończył się szybciej niż Aleksandrze Mirosław zajmuje wspięcie się na szczyt ścianki.

Przynajmniej klątwa chorążych nie działa na Paraolimpiadzie, do srebrnego medalu Lucyny Kordobys dzisiaj Maciej Lepiato dołożył brąz. Może tutaj klątwa ogranicza się do nie najlepszej transmisji zawodów (choć można się kłócić, że rzut kulą zawodników używających siedzisk jest ""trudno"" pokazać w ekscytujący sposób).

To uczucie, gdy człowiek musi napisać, że z 21 (22) medalami obecne Paraigrzyska są wciąż najgorszymi w historii Polski pod względem ilości, ale jeszcze dwa (jak się uprzeć to półtora) dni zawodów przed nami i najpewniej jeszcze poprawimy ten wynik (ścigamy Tokio z 24 medalami w sumie). Ale za to pod względem klasycznej tabeli medalowej w Paryżu jest już lepiej niż w Pekinie 2008, gdzie skończyliśmy ""tylko"" z 5 złotymi medalami.

Z jednej strony, chciałbym zobaczyć na żywo (w telewizji) występ chociaż w połowie tak dobry jak na [Paraolimpiadzie w 1980 roku](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polska_na_Letnich_Igrzyskach_Paraolimpijskich_1980). Z drugiej, jak sobie pomyślę, o robieniu tabelki na ~100 medali, to czuję jak bardzo by mi się nie chciało, przynajmniej w kwestii formatowania do którego nikt mnie nie zmusza.

#Parakolarstwo szosowe

**Wyścig ze startu wspólnego, mężczyźni, [kategoria B](https://lexi.global/sports/cycling-road/v-i)**:

Ciekawe czy w czasie powitania parasportowców na lotnisku w Warszawie, ktoś z kibiców lub reporterów się ""kapnął"", że jeszcze nie wszyscy dotarli do celu. Dorota czekała jeszcze na ceremonię medalową (finał był dopiero dzisiaj), a Karolina dopiero jutro zakończy turniej (wyjątkowo finał będzie tego samego dnia co półfinał).

A co do meczu to ciekawostka, do igrzysk w Tokio reprezentantka Chin startowała w kategorii [TT8](https://lexi.global/sports/table-tennis/standing-tt8). Więc w sumie muszę wspomnieć, że kategorie zawodników to nie jest coś ustalone w kamieniu - okresowo zawodnicy są badani i podlegają ocenie jak ich obecny stan i sprawność plasuje ich w ""skali niepełnosprawności"".

"Igrzyska Paraolimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 07.09. (sobota) | Plan startów 08.09. (niedziela, ostatni dzień)","Dziesiąty dzień występów Polaków i Polek na Igrzyskach Paraolimpijskich za nami.

Na wstępie chcę przeprosić za wszelkie pomyłki w planach na następny dzień - powinienem ufać mniej stażyście od strony Polsatu. Bo jak teraz wpisuję wyścigi pływackie, to jest tam tona błędów (złe dystanse i kategorie).

Kolejne medale, kolejne złoto, kolejny raz już to piszę, jeżeli kolejny raz się nie mylę. Jak widać posiadanie niepełnosprawności (czy to wrodzonej, czy ""nabytej"") nie stanowi problemu w uprawianiu sportu na najwyższym poziomie (w odpowiedniej kategorii). A i wiek nie stanowi dużego problemu, bo medale zdobywają i nastolatkowie (i to tacy młodsi - jak dobrze pamiętam, to w pływaniu medal zdobyła 13-latka) i osoby mocno dorosłe (i nie mówię tu o ""spokojnych"" sportach jak boccia, jeździectwo czy strzelectwo - Barbara Bieganowska&#8205;-&#8205;Zając wygrała złoto w biegu na 1500 metrów w wieku 43 lat, a do tego planuje start w Los Angeles, a rywalka Karoliny Pęk w dzisiejszym finale paratenisa stołowego ma 48 lat, a poważną karierę parasportową zaczęła podobno w wieku 37 lat). Tak więc jeżeli znacie kogoś z niepełnosprawnością albo sami ją macie i zastanawiacie się co możecie w życiu robić, uprawianie sportu jest potencjalną opcją.

Jutro czekają nas starty tylko dwójki Polaków. O ile nie wykluczam powtórki z Igrzysk Olimpijskich, gdzie zdobyliśmy medal ostatniego dnia, tak patrząc na dostępne dane dla zawodów to nie nastawiałbym się na zwiększenie naszego dorobku medalowego. W związku z tym można już chyba powoli podsumowywać występy naszych reprezentantów.

No i oczywiście czeka nas ceremonia zamknięcia Igrzysk Paraolimpijskich i pożegnanie [Frygijek](https://i.redd.it/51bvpobbqmgd1.jpeg) - maskotek, które były chłodno przyjęte gdy je ogłoszono, a które stały się ulubieńcami wszystkich.

**Wyścig ze startu wspólnego, mężczyźni, [kategoria C1-3](https://lexi.global/sports/cycling-road/c1-3)**:

 - Zbigniew Maciejewski ([C1](https://lexi.global/sports/cycling-road/c1)):
    - wynik: **18.** miejsce.

Gdyby to była jazda na czas, to zawodnikom niższych kategorii dano by współczynnik do mierzonego czasu, żeby wyniki były ""bardziej sprawiedliwe"" w związku z większą niepełnosprawnością. Niestety w przypadku wyścigu ze startu wspólnego się go nie stosuje (bo nie ma za bardzo gdzie), więc zawodnicy z niższych klas są od początku na gorszej pozycji. W ramach ""ciekawostki"" Polak był drugim zawodnikiem z kategorii C1 na mecie.

#Parapływanie

**200 metrów stylem zmiennym, mężczyźni, [kategoria SM10](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/individual-medley/sm10)**:

 - Alan Ogorzałek:
    - kwalifikacje: 4. miejsce;
    - finał: **6.** miejsce.

**200 metrów stylem zmiennym, kobiety, [kategoria SM10](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/individual-medley/sm10)**:

 - Oliwia Jabłońska:
    - kwalifikacje: **9.** miejsce.

**100 metrów stylem motylkowym, mężczyźni, [kategoria S8](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/freestyle-backstroke-butterfly/s8)**:

 - Michał Golus:
    - kwalifikacje: 4. miejsce;
    - finał: **5.** miejsce.

**200 metrów stylem dowolnym, mężczyźni, [kategoria S3](https://lexi.global/sports/swimming/freestyle-backstroke-butterfly/s3)**:

 - Krzysztof Lechniak:
    - kwalifikacje: 5. miejsce;
    - finał: **7.** miejsce.

W przypadkach Alana i Michała obaj poprawili swoje czasy z kwalifikacji w wyścigach finałowych, ale rywale poprawili się jeszcze bardziej.
 
#Paratenis stołowy

**Turniej singlowy, kobiety, [kategoria WS9](https://lexi.global/sports/table-tennis/standing-tt9)**:

 - **Karolina Pęk** 🥇:
    - półfinał: 3:0 (11:7, 11:8, 11:7), rywalka: Alexa Szvitacs (Węgry);
    - finał: **3**:2 (11:7, 2:11, 4:11, 13:11, 11:8), rywalka: Xiong Guiyan (Chiny).

Turniej paratenisa stołowego kończymy z kolejnym złotem i kolejnymi emocjami typowymi dla sportów rozgrywanych do 3 setów.

#Parapodnoszenie ciężarów

**Kategoria do 61 kilogramów, mężczyźni, [*tu w sumie nie ma kategorii*](https://lexi.global/sports/powerlifting/heavyweight)**:

 - Wawrzyniec Latus:
    - wynik: **10.** miejsce.

#Parakajakarstwo

*Zamiast ""normalnych"" kanadyjek, tutaj używa się va'a (kanadyjki z przyczepionym dodatkowym mini-kadłubem w celu stabilizacji, chyba zawsze po stronie wiosłowania).*

**200 metrów kajaków, mężczyźni, [kategoria KL3](https://lexi.global/sports/canoe/kl3)**:

*Półfinał (tylko jeden bieg): 6 do finału A. Reszta out.*

 - Mateusz Surwiłło:
    - półfinał: 6. miejsce w biegu;
    - finał A: **7.** miejsce.

**200 metrów kanadyjek, kobiety, [kategoria VL3](https://lexi.global/sports/canoe/vl3)**:

*Półfinały: 3 do finału A. Reszta do finału B.*

 - Monika Kukla:
    - półfinał: 3. miejsce w biegu;
    - finał A: **8.** miejsce.

#Szermierka na wózkach

*Zespoły w zawodach drużynowych składają się z 3 zawodników + rezerwowego (gdzie w przeciwieństwie do zwykłej szermierki można zmieniać zawodników więcej niż raz na cały turniej), przy czym jeden zawodnik MUSI BYĆ kategorii B, a w czasie pojedynku trzeba rozegrać przynajmniej 3 pojedynki będąc reprezentowanym przez zawodnika kategorii B (czyli nie można wystawić kogoś z kategorii B i go zastąpić w połowie starcia kimś z kategorii A).*

**Szpada drużynowo, kobiety, [kategoria A-B](https://lexi.global/sports/wheelchair-fencing/epee-team)**:

 - Polska (Marta Fidrych ([A](https://lexi.global/sports/wheelchair-fencing/epee-cat-a)), Kinga Dróżdż (A), Jadwiga Pacek ([B](https://lexi.global/sports/wheelchair-fencing/epee-cat-b)):
    - ćwierćfinał: **35**:45, rywalki: Ukraina.

**Szpada drużynowo, mężczyźni, [kategoria A-B](https://lexi.global/sports/wheelchair-fencing/epee-team)**:

 - Polska (Michał Nalewajek (A), Dariusz Pender (A), Michał Dąbrowski (B)):
    - ćwierćfinał: 45:34, rywale: Ukraina;
    - półfinał: 20:45, rywale: Chiny;
    - mecz o 3. miejsce: **28**:45, rywale: Wielka Brytania.

#Paralekkoatletyka

*Znalazłem ciekawy PDF po angielsku z krótkim opisem [każdej kategorii klas w lekkoatletyce](https://paralympics.ie/wp-content/uploads/Athletics_Para-Athletics-Classes-Description-Sheet-1.pdf).*

**Pchnięcie kulą, mężczyźni, [kategoria F34](https://lexi.global/sports/athletics/field/f34)**:

 - Tomasz Pauliński:
    - finał: **8.** miejsce.

**Bieg na 200 metrów, mężczyźni, [kategoria T37](https://lexi.global/sports/athletics/track/t37)**:

 - Michał Kotkowski:
    - finał: **6.** miejsce.

**Pchnięcie kulą, kobiety, [kategoria F40](https://lexi.global/sports/athletics/field/f40)**:

*Kategoria F40 jest dla ""szczególnie niskich osób"" (obecnie nie jestem do końca pewien, co dokładnie dzieli F40 i F41, która też jest kategorią dla osób cierpiących na niskorosłość. Różnicą ""na oko"" jest to, że zawodnicy w kategorii F41 są więksi).*

 - **Renata Śliwińska** 🥈:
    - finał: **2.** miejsce.

##CEREMONIA ZAMKNIĘCIA

20:30 - Ceremonia Zamknięcia (będzie także na Super Polsat, ale nie mam pojęcia czy to kanał ogólnodostępny czy kodowany. Choć przynajmniej może być w bardziej podstawowym pakiecie niż kanały kodowane, jak ktoś posiada telewizję satelitarną, lub inny dekoder, z bardzo podstawowym pakietem)

[Żródło](https://www.polsatsport.pl/wiadomosc/2024-09-07/plan-startow-polakow-na-niedziele/). [Erraty w ciągu dnia](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/paralympic-games/schedule/poland?day=8-september). A tu [plan transmisji](https://www.polsatsport.pl/wiadomosc/2024-09-07/igrzyska-paralimpijskie-2024-plan-transmisji-na-niedziele-08-09/) Polsatu.",Polska,2024-09-07 21:24:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/1fbhlt7/igrzyska_paraolimpijskie_wyniki_polaków_i_polek/,"Igrzyska Paraolimpijskie | Wyniki Polaków i Polek 07.09. (sobota) | Plan startów 08.09. (niedziela, ostatni dzień) Dziesiąty dzień występów Polaków i Polek na Igrzyskach Paraolimpijskich za nami.

Na wstępie chcę przeprosić za wszelkie pomyłki w planach na następny dzień - powinienem ufać mniej stażyście od strony Polsatu. Bo jak teraz wpisuję wyścigi pływackie, to jest tam tona błędów (złe dystanse i kategorie).

Kolejne medale, kolejne złoto, kolejny raz już to piszę, jeżeli kolejny raz się nie mylę. Jak widać posiadanie niepełnosprawności (czy to wrodzonej, czy ""nabytej"") nie stanowi problemu w uprawianiu sportu na najwyższym poziomie (w odpowiedniej kategorii). A i wiek nie stanowi dużego problemu, bo medale zdobywają i nastolatkowie (i to tacy młodsi - jak dobrze pamiętam, to w pływaniu medal zdobyła 13-latka) i osoby mocno dorosłe (i nie mówię tu o ""spokojnych"" sportach jak boccia, jeździectwo czy strzelectwo - Barbara Bieganowska&#8205;-&#8205;Zając wygrała złoto w biegu na 1500 metrów w wieku 43 lat, a do tego planuje start w Los Angeles, a rywalka Karoliny Pęk w dzisiejszym finale paratenisa stołowego ma 48 lat, a poważną karierę parasportową zaczęła podobno w wieku 37 lat). Tak więc jeżeli znacie kogoś z niepełnosprawnością albo sami ją macie i zastanawiacie się co możecie w życiu robić, uprawianie sportu jest potencjalną opcją.

Jutro czekają nas starty tylko dwójki Polaków. O ile nie wykluczam powtórki z Igrzysk Olimpijskich, gdzie zdobyliśmy medal ostatniego dnia, tak patrząc na dostępne dane dla zawodów to nie nastawiałbym się na zwiększenie naszego dorobku medalowego. W związku z tym można już chyba powoli podsumowywać występy naszych reprezentantów.

No i oczywiście czeka nas ceremonia zamknięcia Igrzysk Paraolimpijskich i pożegnanie [Frygijek](https://i.redd.it/51bvpobbqmgd1.jpeg) - maskotek, które były chłodno przyjęte gdy je ogłoszono, a które stały się ulubieńcami wszystkich.

Wczorajszy dzień upłynął pod znakiem porażek, rozczarowań i smutku. Dzisiejszy dzień postanowił oddać z nawiązką - pierwszy złoty medal tych igrzysk, kolejny brąz (oba w tej samej konkurencji) i awans dwóch/czternastu (wytłumaczenie drugiej liczby w sekcji siatkówki) zawodników do finałów dwuosobowych/dwuzespołowych. Do tego awanse do półfinałów i finałów w innych dyscyplinach.

Wczoraj wyraziłem smutek, że nie miałem okazji uzupełnić tej tabelki. No to dzisiaj dostałem okazję wpisania dwóch kolejnych pozycji. A z niej widać, że polski sport kobietami stoi (wśród oczekujących medali mamy remis 1:1).

------------------------------------------------

#Wyniki Polaków z dziś (07.08.)

#Lekkoatletyka

**Chód sportowy, sztafeta mieszana**

*Sztafeta odbywa się na dystansie maratońskim, z mężczyzną ~~biegnącym~~ ~~idącym~~ marszobiegnącym (bądźmy szczerzy, ta dyscyplina polega na jak najlepszym ""oszukiwaniu"" sędziów, że się nie łamie przepisów) trochę dłuższy dystans niż kobieta.*

 - Maher Ben Hlima, Olga Chojecka:
    - **16.** miejsce.

**100 metrów przez płotki, kobiety**

*Kwalifikacje: awans 3+3 do półfinału, reszta do repasaży.*

 - Pia Skrzyszowska:
    - kwalifikacje: 3. miejsce w biegu.

**Rzut oszczepem, kobiety**

*Najlepsza 12 kwalifikacji awansuje do finału. Zawodniczki, które wypełniły minimum kwalifikacyjne awansują do finału nawet jeżeli zajęły dalsze miejsce.*

 - Maria Andrejczyk:
    - kwalifikacje: wypełniła minimum kwalifikacyjne w pierwszej próbie.

Ocenienie sytuacji przed finałem (który odbędzie się, a jakże, w sobotę) jest niemal niemożliwe, bo sporo zawodniczek załatwiło sobie kwalifikację spełniając minimum, więc ciężko powiedzieć, czy ich rzuty to było ich maksimum (a nawet to nie jest pewne, bo dla przykładu Anita w rzucie młotem mocno się poprawiła w porównaniu do kwalifikacji, gdzie oddała wszystkie 3 rzuty), czy wciąż do niego daleko. Ale Maria dała nadzieję, że można na nią liczyć.

**800 metrów, mężczyźni**

*Kwalifikacje: awans 3+0 do półfinału, reszta do repasaży.*

 - Mateusz Borkowski:
    - 7. miejsce w biegu.

**1500 metrów, kobiety**

*Repasaże: awans 3+0 do półfinału, reszta out.*

 - Aleksandra Płocińska:
    - repasaże: **9.** miejsce w biegu.
 
**400 metrów, kobiety**

*Półfinały: awans 2+2 do finału.*

 - Natalia Kaczmarek:
    - półfinał: 1. miejsce w biegu.

Półfinał przebieg gładko, ale finał (dla niepoznaki w piątek) będzie wyzwaniem. Do tego gdzieś na dniach powinny odbywać się sztafety 4x400 metrów kobiet, więc nie wiadomo jak wpłynie to na zawodniczki w niej startujących.

#Kajakarstwo

*Opis skrótów:*

 - *K - Kajaki (""wiosła o dwóch końcach"")*;
 - *C - kanadyjki (Canoe) (""wiosła o jednym końcu"", dodatkowo tutaj startują w pozycji klęczącej (gdzie w kanadyjkach w slalomie zawodnicy siedzą w łodzi))*;
 - *1 - jedynki (jeden zawodnik)*;
 - *2 - dwójki*;
 - *4 - czwórki*.

**K1, 500 metrów, kobiety**

*Kwalifikacje: 2 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu przechodzą do półfinału, reszta do ćwierćfinału.*

*Ćwierćfinał: 5 najlepszych zawodniczek w biegu przechodzą do półfinału, reszta odpada.*

*Półfinał (w sobotę): 2 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu przechodzą do Finału A (miejsca 1.-8.), kolejne dwie przechodzą do Finału B (miejsca 9.-16.). Dwie kolejne do Finału C (miejsca 17.-24.). Reszta odpada.*

 - Dominika Putto:
    - kwalifikacje: 3. miejsce w biegu;
    - ćwierćfinał: 1. miejsce w biegu.

**C1, 1000 metrów, mężczyźni**

*Kwalifikacje: 2 najlepszych zawodników w biegu przechodzi do półfinału, reszta do ćwierćfinału.*

*Ćwierćfinał: 2 najlepszych zawodników w biegu przechodzi do półfinału, reszta odpada.*

*Półfinał (w piątek): 4 najlepszych zawodników w biegu przechodzi do Finału A (miejsca 1.-8.), reszta do Finału B (miejsca 9. i niżej).*

 - Wiktor Głazunow:
    - kwalifikacje: 1. miejsce w biegu.

Szybko. Gładko. I przyjemnie.

#Zapasy

*W przypadku punktowego remisu zwycięzcą walki zostaje zawodnik, który jako ostatni wykonał najwyżej punktowaną technikę w czasie walki.*

**Kategoria do 87 kilogramów, styl klasyczny, mężczyźni**

 - Arkadiusz Kułynycz:
    - 1/8 finału: 5:3, rywal: Ali Cengiz (Turcja);
    - 1/4 finału: 1:10, rywal: Alireza Mohmadi (Iran):
       - półfinał przeciwnika: wygrana 3\*:3, rywal: Zhan Beleniuk (Ukraina).
    - pierwszy dzień: Polak awansował do walki repasażowej.

Polak dobrze się spisał w pierwszej walce, szczególnie że Turek jest obecnym mistrzem świata, ale w drugiej musiał uznać wyższość swojego rywala. Dosłownie, bo w zapasach walka kończy się przed czasem jeżeli zawodnika ma 8 (w stylu klasycznym) lub 10 (w stylu wolnym) punktów przewagi. Na szczęście Irańczyk awansował do finału, co oznacza, że Polak będzie mieć szanse na brązowy medal w repasażach.

#Wspinaczka sportowa

**Speed**

*Dzisiaj rywalizacja była prosta: dwie zawodniczki stoją pod ścianą, kto wespnie się pierwszy zostaje ~~nową Spiderwoman~~ zwycięzcą.*

 - **Aleksandra Mirosław 🥇**:
    - ćwierćfinał: wygrana, rywalka: Leslie Romero Perez (Hiszpania);
    - półfinał: wygrana, rywalka: Aleksandra Kałucka (Polska);
    - finał: **wygrana**, rywalka: Deng Lijuan (Chiny).

 - **Aleksandra Kałucka 🥉**:
    - ćwierćfinał: wygrana, rywalka: Zhou Yafei (Chiny);
    - półfinał: przegrana, rywalka: Aleksandra Mirosław (Polska);
    - bieg o 3. miejsce: **wygrana**, rywalka: Rajiah Sallasbillah (Indonezja).

Jeżeli w trzeciej części animowanego Spider-versu dodadzą polskiego pająka to po pierwsze musi być kobietą/dziewczyną, a po drugie mieć na imię Aleksandra. Można się kłócić, czy lepiej by było jakby Polki mogły na siebie trafić dopiero w finale, ale chyba trafiło się idealnie, biorąc pod uwagę błąd Amerykanki (jednej z faworytek do medali) w ćwierćfinale, który w ostateczności doprowadził do tego, że Kałucka walczyła z Indonezyjką o brąz.

#Kolarstwo torowe

*Rekordy świata, rekordy świata dla każdego.*

**Sprint, mężczyźni**

*Najpierw mamy rundę klasyfikacyjną, gdzie każdy jedzie sam by ustanowić jak najlepszy czas. Potem mamy pojedynki dwóch zawodników, gdzie losowane jest, kto ma prowadzić przez pierwsze pół okrążenia (w sumie chyba przejeżdżają trzy, z czego tylko ostatnie jest mierzone. Nawet nie wiem po co... Kto pierwszy ten wygrywa, kto drugi ten albo trafia do repasaży albo odpada.*

*Edit: najwyraźniej w repasażach po 1/8 finału startuje trzech zawodników. PLEASE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!*

*Jakiś geniusz układał plan tej konkurencji, bo wzięli ""idealną"" liczbę zawodników, by po każdej dzisiejszej rundzie (1/32, 1/16 i 1/8 finału) odbywały się repasaże.*

 - Mateusz Rudyk:
    - próba czasowa: 11. czas;
    - 1/32 finału: wygrana, rywal: Sam Dakin (Australia);
    - 1/16 finału: przegrana, rywal: Jeffrey Hoogland (Holandia);
    - repasaże 1/16 finału: wygrana, rywal: Jair Tjon En Fa (Surinam);
    - 1/8 finału: przegrana, rywal: Matthew Richardson (Australia);
    - repasaże 1/18 finału: wygrana, rywale: Mikhail Yakovlew (Izrael) oraz Mohd Azizulhasni Awang (Malezja).

Dobra wiadomość: Polak jest w Top 8 zawodów.

Zła wiadomość: Polak będzie się ścigać ze zwycięzcą próby czasowej i obecnym rekordzistą świata (najprawdopodobniej do następnych zawodów, a już na pewno jedynie do następnej Olimpiady i nie dłużej).

**Keirin, kobiety**

*Sport o ciekawej historii, bo zaczął jako sport stworzony po to, by uprawiać bukmacherkę w Japonii, obstawiając kto wygra wyścig (coś jak wyścigi konne ale bez koni).*

*Wyścig trwa 6 okrążeń, z czego przez pierwsze 3 okrążenia zawodnicy podążają za derną nadającej tempo. Zawodnicy zaczynają jazdę w kolejności wylosowanej przed biegiem. Póki derna nie zjedzie całkowicie z toru, zawodniczy nie mogą wyprzedzić nawet końcówki jej tylnego koła (albo na ostatnich Igrzyskach, albo na jeszcze poprzedniej edycji była lekka afera w finale męskiego keirinu, bo spora część zawodników złamała ten przepis, ale nie została wykluczona).*

*Awanse:*

 - *kwalifikacje: 2 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do ćwierćfinału, reszta do repasaży;*
 - *repasaże: 2 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do ćwierćfinału, reszta out;*
 - *ćwierćfinał: 4 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do półfinału;*
 - *półfinał: 3 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do finału;*
 - *finał: kto dojedzie pierwszy ten wygrywa.*

 - Marlena Karwacka:
    - kwalifikacje: 3. miejsce w biegu;
    - repasaże: **3.** miejsce w biegu,

 - Urszula Łoś:
    - kwalifikacje: 5. miejsce w biegu;
    - repasaże: **5.** miejsce w biegu. 

#Żeglarstwo

A TAKIEGO CH>!UJA!<, NIE MA TAKIEGO ANI INNEGO WIATRU! >:)

Dzisiaj w klasie Formuła Kite (jedynej, gdzie ""startowali"" Polacy) zaplanowano 9 wyścigów mężczyzn i 10 wyścigów kobiet, z nadzieją wykonania jak największej ilości. Ta ilość wyniosła po zsumowaniu 0 (ZERO). Jutro mają być finały, więc sędziowie uznali, że pierdolą, nie robią. Walter Hofer nie byłby z nich dumny.

*W Formule Kite dwóch najlepszych zawodników awansuje do finału, a zawodnicy z miejsc od trzeciego do dziesiątego przechodzą do półfinałów. Odbywają się dwa biegi półfinałowe, bo 4 zawodników, a ich zwycięzcy przechodzą do finału.* 

**Formuła Kite, mężczyźni**

 - Maksymilian Żakowski:
    - faza klasyfikacyjna: **16.** miejsce.

Polak potrzebował cudu, by dostać się do Top 10, ale cud się nie wydarzył. Przy czym najwyraźniej cudem nie były dobre występy, a dobry wiatr.

**Formuła Kite, kobiety**

 - Julia Damasiewicz:
    - faza klasyfikacyjna: 9. miejsce.

Dobrze, że wczorajsze niepojawienie się Polki na starcie (razem z siedmioma innymi zawodniczkami w 20-osobowej stawce) nie miało znaczenie. Bo jakby wypadła wtedy z Top 10, to by straciła półfinał, bo odwołano wszystkie inne biegi. 

#Siatkówka

**Turniej halowy, mężczyźni**

*No to czas na tłumaczenie obiecane na początku. Normalnie w turnieju olimpijskim może brać udział jedynie 12 zawodników, ale trenerzy mogli powołać 13. zawodnika rezerwowego, którego można wezwać jedynie w ramach kontuzji kogoś z podstawowej 12., zapewne jako zmiana ostateczna (więc jak kontuzjowany zawodnik wyzdrowieje to nie może wrócić. To by tłumaczyło, dlaczego trzymali Fornala w składzie). Nie jestem pewien czy ten 13. zawodnik ""na starcie"" jest w ogóle traktowany jako olimpijczyk, bo kojarzę jakiś artykuł o tym, że grupa trenerów próbowała przekonać kogoś (pewnie MKOl), by ten zawodnik mógł mieszkać w wiosce olimpijskiej, więc myślę, że jest ryzyko, że taki zawodnik nie dostałby nawet medalu. Ale ponieważ Polacy byli w końcu zmuszeni zastosować taką zmianę (bo tym razem zawodnik kontuzjowany nie zdążyłby na dalszą część turnieju), to mamy sytuację, że kontuzjowany zawodnik zagrał mecz na turnieju, jak i jego zastępca. A głupio nie byłoby dawać medalu komuś, kto grał mecz, więc powinniśmy dostać 13 medali dla zawodników.*

 - **Polska 🏅**:
    - półfinał: 3:2 (25:23, 25:27, 14:25, 25:23, 15:13) , rywal: USA.

Polacy chyba postanowili utożsamić się z fanami i padają jak muchy (przynajmniej nie na zawały serca). Najpierw zderzenie z kolegą z zespołu w trzecim secie o mało nie wyeliminowało Pawła Zatorskiego, który stał się naszym najsłabszym ogniwem aż do momentu otrzymania leków przeciwbólowych na chyba bark. Potem Marcin Janusz musiał opuścić boisko, a oglądając powtórkę-skrót meczu na Polsacie Sport w jakieś późniejszych akcji Formal chyba o mało nie uszkodził Leona jak na niego wpadł i go odepchnął z dużym impetem.

Ale koniec końców, w najbardziej polskosiatkarskim stylu jaki był możliwy, nasi siatkarze pomścili siatkarki. A finał w sobotę.

#Boks

**Kategoria do 57 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - **Julia Szeremeta 🏅**:
    - półfinał: 4:1 (28:29, 29:28, 29:28, 29:28, 29:28), rywalka: Nesthy Petecio (Filipiny).

Naczekaliśmy się na półfinał, naczekamy się i na finał (w sobotę). Jako ciekawostka: Julia będzie Polką, która otrzyma medal najlepszego koloru na kortach Rolanda Garrosa. Bo tam odbywają się finały boksu.

Edit: Próbując znaleźć coś innego, znalazłem informację, że przeciwniczką Julii w finale będzie jedna z bokserek wokół której rozpętała się afera o niezaliczenie testów federacji bokserskiej. Więc jeżeli nie posiadacie wzmocnionego stroju szambonurka, to radzę nie szukać informacji o finale, przed nim i po.

""TL;DR"": [Źródło tych informacji](https://sport.tvp.pl/79668436/olimpiada-2024-starty-medale-i-wyniki-polakow-na-igrzyskach-olimpijskich-7-sierpnia)

*Pogrubienie* - konkurencje, gdzie jest bardzo blisko strefy medalowej (sporty ""versus"" - ćwierćfinał lub lepiej, sporty ""wieloosobowe"" - normalnie 8- zawodników w finale, w szczególnych przypadkach może być ich więcej, ale o niewiele). *Kursywa* - konkurencje, w których Polacy i Polki nie mają prawa startu w czasie pisania tego posta. Normalnym zachowaniem jest brak zmiany danych, ale czasami może dam jakąś aktualizację.

W niektórych przypadkach godziny są dokładne, w niektórych oznaczają tylko godziny startu całej sesji, więc radzę pilnować na bieżąco rzeczy jakie ktoś chce oglądać.

Wczorajszy dzień upłynął pod znakiem porażek, rozczarowań i smutku. Dzisiejszy dzień postanowił oddać z nawiązką - pierwszy złoty medal tych igrzysk, kolejny brąz (oba w tej samej konkurencji) i awans dwóch/czternastu (wytłumaczenie drugiej liczby w sekcji siatkówki) zawodników do finałów dwuosobowych/dwuzespołowych. Do tego awanse do półfinałów i finałów w innych dyscyplinach.

Szczególnie, że jak patrzę na plany turniejowe dzisiejszych zawodów, to kilka z nich też ma finały w sobotę.

    - bieg o 3. miejsce: **wygrana**, rywalka: Rajiah Sallasbillah (Indonezja).

Jeżeli w trzeciej części animowanego Spider-versu dodadzą polskiego pająka to po pierwsze musi być kobietą/dziewczyną, a po drugie mieć na imię Aleksandra. Można się kłócić, czy lepiej by było jakby Polki mogły na siebie trafić dopiero w finale, ale chyba trafiło się idealnie, biorąc pod uwagę błąd Amerykanki (jednej z faworytek do medali) w ćwierćfinale, który w ostateczności doprowadził do tego, że Kałucka walczyła z Indonezyjką o brąz.

#Kolarstwo torowe

*Rekordy świata, rekordy świata dla każdego.*

**Sprint, mężczyźni**

*Najpierw mamy rundę klasyfikacyjną, gdzie każdy jedzie sam by ustanowić jak najlepszy czas. Potem mamy pojedynki dwóch zawodników, gdzie losowane jest, kto ma prowadzić przez pierwsze pół okrążenia (w sumie chyba przejeżdżają trzy, z czego tylko ostatnie jest mierzone. Nawet nie wiem po co... Kto pierwszy ten wygrywa, kto drugi ten albo trafia do repasaży albo odpada.*

*Edit: najwyraźniej w repasażach po 1/8 finału startuje trzech zawodników. PLEASE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!*

*Jakiś geniusz układał plan tej konkurencji, bo wzięli ""idealną"" liczbę zawodników, by po każdej dzisiejszej rundzie (1/32, 1/16 i 1/8 finału) odbywały się repasaże.*

 - Mateusz Rudyk:
    - próba czasowa: 11. czas;
    - 1/32 finału: wygrana, rywal: Sam Dakin (Australia);
    - 1/16 finału: przegrana, rywal: Jeffrey Hoogland (Holandia);
    - repasaże 1/16 finału: wygrana, rywal: Jair Tjon En Fa (Surinam);
    - 1/8 finału: przegrana, rywal: Matthew Richardson (Australia);
    - repasaże 1/18 finału: wygrana, rywale: Mikhail Yakovlew (Izrael) oraz Mohd Azizulhasni Awang (Malezja).

Dobra wiadomość: Polak jest w Top 8 zawodów.

Zła wiadomość: Polak będzie się ścigać ze zwycięzcą próby czasowej i obecnym rekordzistą świata (najprawdopodobniej do następnych zawodów, a już na pewno jedynie do następnej Olimpiady i nie dłużej).

**Keirin, kobiety**

*Sport o ciekawej historii, bo zaczął jako sport stworzony po to, by uprawiać bukmacherkę w Japonii, obstawiając kto wygra wyścig (coś jak wyścigi konne ale bez koni).*

*Wyścig trwa 6 okrążeń, z czego przez pierwsze 3 okrążenia zawodnicy podążają za derną nadającej tempo. Zawodnicy zaczynają jazdę w kolejności wylosowanej przed biegiem. Póki derna nie zjedzie całkowicie z toru, zawodniczy nie mogą wyprzedzić nawet końcówki jej tylnego koła (albo na ostatnich Igrzyskach, albo na jeszcze poprzedniej edycji była lekka afera w finale męskiego keirinu, bo spora część zawodników złamała ten przepis, ale nie została wykluczona).*

*Awanse:*

 - *kwalifikacje: 2 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do ćwierćfinału, reszta do repasaży;*
 - *repasaże: 2 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do ćwierćfinału, reszta out;*
 - *ćwierćfinał: 4 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do półfinału;*
 - *półfinał: 3 najlepsze zawodniczki w biegu awansuje do finału;*
 - *finał: kto dojedzie pierwszy ten wygrywa.*

 - Marlena Karwacka:
    - kwalifikacje: 3. miejsce w biegu;
    - repasaże: **3.** miejsce w biegu,

 - Urszula Łoś:
    - kwalifikacje: 5. miejsce w biegu;
    - repasaże: **5.** miejsce w biegu. 

#Żeglarstwo

A TAKIEGO CH>!UJA!<, NIE MA TAKIEGO ANI INNEGO WIATRU! >:)

Dzisiaj w klasie Formuła Kite (jedynej, gdzie ""startowali"" Polacy) zaplanowano 9 wyścigów mężczyzn i 10 wyścigów kobiet, z nadzieją wykonania jak największej ilości. Ta ilość wyniosła po zsumowaniu 0 (ZERO). Jutro mają być finały, więc sędziowie uznali, że pierdolą, nie robią. Walter Hofer nie byłby z nich dumny.

*W Formule Kite dwóch najlepszych zawodników awansuje do finału, a zawodnicy z miejsc od trzeciego do dziesiątego przechodzą do półfinałów. Odbywają się dwa biegi półfinałowe, bo 4 zawodników, a ich zwycięzcy przechodzą do finału.* 

**Formuła Kite, mężczyźni**

 - Maksymilian Żakowski:
    - faza klasyfikacyjna: **16.** miejsce.

Polak potrzebował cudu, by dostać się do Top 10, ale cud się nie wydarzył. Przy czym najwyraźniej cudem nie były dobre występy, a dobry wiatr.

**Formuła Kite, kobiety**

 - Julia Damasiewicz:
    - faza klasyfikacyjna: 9. miejsce.

Dobrze, że wczorajsze niepojawienie się Polki na starcie (razem z siedmioma innymi zawodniczkami w 20-osobowej stawce) nie miało znaczenie. Bo jakby wypadła wtedy z Top 10, to by straciła półfinał, bo odwołano wszystkie inne biegi. 

#Siatkówka

**Turniej halowy, mężczyźni**

*No to czas na tłumaczenie obiecane na początku. Normalnie w turnieju olimpijskim może brać udział jedynie 12 zawodników, ale trenerzy mogli powołać 13. zawodnika rezerwowego, którego można wezwać jedynie w ramach kontuzji kogoś z podstawowej 12., zapewne jako zmiana ostateczna (więc jak kontuzjowany zawodnik wyzdrowieje to nie może wrócić. To by tłumaczyło, dlaczego trzymali Fornala w składzie). Nie jestem pewien czy ten 13. zawodnik ""na starcie"" jest w ogóle traktowany jako olimpijczyk, bo kojarzę jakiś artykuł o tym, że grupa trenerów próbowała przekonać kogoś (pewnie MKOl), by ten zawodnik mógł mieszkać w wiosce olimpijskiej, więc myślę, że jest ryzyko, że taki zawodnik nie dostałby nawet medalu. Ale ponieważ Polacy byli w końcu zmuszeni zastosować taką zmianę (bo tym razem zawodnik kontuzjowany nie zdążyłby na dalszą część turnieju), to mamy sytuację, że kontuzjowany zawodnik zagrał mecz na turnieju, jak i jego zastępca. A głupio nie byłoby dawać medalu komuś, kto grał mecz, więc powinniśmy dostać 13 medali dla zawodników.*

 - **Polska 🏅**:
    - półfinał: 3:2 (25:23, 25:27, 14:25, 25:23, 15:13) , rywal: USA.

Polacy chyba postanowili utożsamić się z fanami i padają jak muchy (przynajmniej nie na zawały serca). Najpierw zderzenie z kolegą z zespołu w trzecim secie o mało nie wyeliminowało Pawła Zatorskiego, który stał się naszym najsłabszym ogniwem aż do momentu otrzymania leków przeciwbólowych na chyba bark. Potem Marcin Janusz musiał opuścić boisko, a oglądając powtórkę-skrót meczu na Polsacie Sport w jakieś późniejszych akcji Formal chyba o mało nie uszkodził Leona jak na niego wpadł i go odepchnął z dużym impetem.

Ale koniec końców, w najbardziej polskosiatkarskim stylu jaki był możliwy, nasi siatkarze pomścili siatkarki. A finał w sobotę.

#Boks

**Kategoria do 57 kilogramów, kobiety**

 - **Julia Szeremeta 🏅**:
    - półfinał: 4:1 (28:29, 29:28, 29:28, 29:28, 29:28), rywalka: Nesthy Petecio (Filipiny).

Naczekaliśmy się na półfinał, naczekamy się i na finał (w sobotę). Jako ciekawostka: Julia będzie Polką, która otrzyma medal najlepszego koloru na kortach Rolanda Garrosa. Bo tam odbywają się finały boksu.

Edit: Próbując znaleźć coś innego, znalazłem informację, że przeciwniczką Julii w finale będzie jedna z bokserek wokół której rozpętała się afera o niezaliczenie testów federacji bokserskiej. Więc jeżeli nie posiadacie wzmocnionego stroju szambonurka, to radzę nie szukać informacji o finale, przed nim i po.

#Plan występów w dniu 08.08.

*Pogrubienie* - konkurencje, gdzie jest bardzo blisko strefy medalowej (sporty ""versus"" - ćwierćfinał lub lepiej, sporty ""wieloosobowe"" - normalnie 8- zawodników w finale, w szczególnych przypadkach może być ich więcej, ale o niewiele). *Kursywa* - konkurencje, w których Polacy i Polki nie mają prawa startu w czasie pisania tego posta. Normalnym zachowaniem jest brak zmiany danych, ale czasami może dam jakąś aktualizację.

W niektórych przypadkach godziny są dokładne, w niektórych oznaczają tylko godziny startu całej sesji, więc radzę pilnować na bieżąco rzeczy jakie ktoś chce oglądać.

Wolność słowa w internecie.,"Ciekawostka - nie tylko r/polska ma problemy z ustaleniem jaka jest granica moderacji. Spór i to sądowy toczy się nawet w ""ojczyźnie wolności słowa"".

Pod koniec zeszłego roku legislatura stanowa w Teksasie uchwaliła ustawę [\(HB 20\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_Bill_20), która, uwaga!, zakazuje platformom internetowym **cenzurowania i moderowania wypowiedzi użytkowników na bazie poglądów**. Twórcy ustawy niespecjalnie kryli, że jest ona motywowana tym, że ""lewackie korporacje (xD) dyskryminują osoby o konserwatywnych poglądach"".

Twitter, Facebook albo inna na R, wyrzucą wypowiedź neonazisty albo kogoś kto np. zachęca do legalizacji gwałtów, to ciężko nie zgodzić się, że robi to ""na bazie jego poglądów"". Dzięki tym przepisom ma on prawo do odwołania się do sądu. Nie jest chyba trudno sobie wyobrazić trudności do jakich to prowadzi - jak w ogóle cokolwiek moderować skoro to grozi pozwem?

Wizyta Premiera w Kijowie,"Dziś premier Donald Tusk będzie spotykał się z Żełeńskim w Kijowie. Wobec tego nasuwa się kluczowe dla polskiej dyplomacji pytanie:

Jakie r/Polska ma oczekiwania wobec dalszych relacji polsko-ukraińskich?

Wszystko wskazuje na to, że Koalicja15.10 będzie kontynuować pisowską politykę wobec Ukrainy. W mojej ocenie ten model się wyczerpał. W sensie Ukrainie nadal należy się wsparcie, ale może czas, na zmianę postawy. Może dobrze by było, żeby Polska zaczęła ograniczać bezwarunkową pomoc i może częściej wspierać Ukrainę pośrednio bardziej w roli fundraisera niż sponsora.

Nie oszukujmy się, ale postawa rządu w Kijowie jest groteskowa. Nie wiem z czego to wynika, ale ich absolutna pogarda do naszych zastrzeżeń i oskarżenia o prorosyjskość jest kompletnie nie na miejscu. W prasie ukraińskiej polscy przewoźnicy są wyzywani od ruskich agentów. O polskich rolnikach pisze się, że to roszczeniowa hołota z bogatą tradycją analfabetyzmu. Rozumiem, że może to być rosyjska propaganda, ale no widać ten sentyment również w zachowaniu Ukrainców na granicy. Polscy kierowcy są ostentacyjnie dyskryminowani, czekają nie raz tydzień na przejazd.

Nie wiem skąd się to bierze. Być może uznali, że Polską można pomiatać i stawiać jej warunki jak psu. Poprzedni rząd nieraz sprawiał takie wrażenie - łącząc pomoc militarną z infantylną pradziejową narracją (słowa typu: Ukraina walczy w obronie Polskości, giną za naszą wolność itp.) i przekuwając ją w antyniemiecki sentyment (patrzcie jak my pomagamy, a oni tylko siedzą) trochę wykreował obraz ""bufetu"". Niestety wygląda na to, że Bruksela jest w tym sporze albo obojętna, albo po stronie Kijowa, a Waszyngton nie miesza się do tego.

Teraz pytanie - co należy zrobić? Jesteśmy gotowi wpuścić na nasz rynek nieuregulowaną żywność z Ukrainy? Przyjmujemy ryzyko bankructw naszych rolników i przewoźników? Naciski ze strony Brukseli, naciski ze strony Kijowa, sabotaż rządu ze strony pisowskich dyplomatów (Polski ambasador w Kijowie zapowiedział, że wizytę Tuska zbojkotuje).

Jak będzie wyglądała 3 wojna światowa pod względem uczestniczących w niej koalicji?,"Odwołam się tutaj do wydarzeń przeszłych, bo są kluczowe dla zrozumienia tego, o czym mówię. W trakcie 2 wojny światowej alianci walczyli z jednej strony z Niemcami i Włochami oraz sojusznikami tych krajów, a z drugiej przeciwko Japonii. Formalnie biorąc, te wojny były powiązane, bo Wielka Brytania i USA znajdowały się równolegle w stanie wojny zarówno z Niemcami, jak i z Japonią. De facto jednak te konflikty były mocno od siebie odseparowane. W 1945 Polacy pewnie mieli gdzieś, co się działo z Japonią, bo nawet, gdyby ta jakimś cudem wygrała wojnę z USA, to średnio nas to dotyczyło.

W każdym razie, mówimy tutaj o dużych konfliktach formalnie połączonych dyplomatycznymi więzami, choć de facto niemającymi tak wiele wspólnego.

Teraz widzę bardzo podobny układ. Rosja chce podporządkować sobie wszystkie byłe państwa ZSRR. Chiny zamierzają połknąć i strawić Tajwan. I znowu, tak jak w trakcie 2 wojny światowej - Stany Zjednoczone czy Wielka Brytania są obydwoma frontami zainteresowane, ale taka Polska skupia się przede wszystkim na Ukrainie/Europie. Tylko że tym razem współpraca Rosji i Chin jest o wiele ściślejsza, niż Niemiec i Japonii.

Oczywiście, po stronie demokracji i wolności staną państwa członkowskie NATO, a oprócz tego Japonia, Australia, Ukraina, Korea Południowa, Izrael, i tak dalej. Część z tych państw skupi się jedynie na tym froncie, który ich będzie dotyczył; część (m.in. USA) na obydwu (albo i na więcej).

Ale obawiam się, że klaryfikuje nam się swoiste monstrum. Zaczyna nam się kształtować sojusz na linii Rosja-Indie-Chiny-Korea Północna-Iran. Ten pięciokąt nienawidzi USA i dzielą ideologię antyamerykańską. Wszystkie z nich uważają świat cywilizacji europejskiej za wroga. I boję się, że z tym pięciokątem nie damy rady. W przeciągu 12 godzin od wybuchu wojny Iran doszczętnie zmiażdży Izrael, a Rosja, Chiny i Korea Płn. zwalą się na Koreę Płd., a Chiny rozwalą Tajwan. Dziesiątki milionów ludzi zginą.

Pytam, czy moje przewidywania dotyczące ww. pięciokątu antyamerykańskiego są słuszne?

Teraz widzę bardzo podobny układ. Rosja chce podporządkować sobie wszystkie byłe państwa ZSRR. Chiny zamierzają połknąć i strawić Tajwan. I znowu, tak jak w trakcie 2 wojny światowej - Stany Zjednoczone czy Wielka Brytania są obydwoma frontami zainteresowane, ale taka Polska skupia się przede wszystkim na Ukrainie/Europie. Tylko że tym razem współpraca Rosji i Chin jest o wiele ściślejsza, niż Niemiec i Japonii.

Oczywiście, po stronie demokracji i wolności staną państwa członkowskie NATO, a oprócz tego Japonia, Australia, Ukraina, Korea Południowa, Izrael, i tak dalej. Część z tych państw skupi się jedynie na tym froncie, który ich będzie dotyczył; część (m.in. USA) na obydwu (albo i na więcej).

Ale obawiam się, że klaryfikuje nam się swoiste monstrum. Zaczyna nam się kształtować sojusz na linii Rosja-Indie-Chiny-Korea Północna-Iran. Ten pięciokąt nienawidzi USA i dzielą ideologię antyamerykańską. Wszystkie z nich uważają świat cywilizacji europejskiej za wroga. I boję się, że z tym pięciokątem nie damy rady. W przeciągu 12 godzin od wybuchu wojny Iran doszczętnie zmiażdży Izrael, a Rosja, Chiny i Korea Płn. zwalą się na Koreę Płd., a Chiny rozwalą Tajwan. Dziesiątki milionów ludzi zginą.

Pytam, czy moje przewidywania dotyczące ww. pięciokątu antyamerykańskiego są słuszne? I czy jesteśmy w stanie ich odeprzeć?",neutral
Tygodniowy wyjazd do Ukrainy. Kilka pytań.,"Witam, w sierpniu wraz z moją kobietą (Ukrainką) planujemy pojechać na tydzień do Ukrainy. Dziewczyna ma tam do załatwienia kilka spraw urzędowych i chciałaby zabrać coś ze swojego starego domu. 

Jeśli jest tu ktoś kto niedawno podróżował w tę stronę i ma jakieś wskazówki / odpowiedzi to byłym wdzięczny za pomoc.

W stronę Ukrainy będziemy jechać samochodem a z powrotem najprawdopodobniej jakimś busem. 

I tutaj kilka pytań:

1. Jaką trasę najlepiej wybrać? 

A) Polska - Ukraina 

B) Czechy - Słowacja - Węgry - Rumunia - Mołdawia - Ukraina? 

Nasze miejsce startowe to okolice Zgorzelca a miejsce docelowe Mikołajów (1600km jeśli jechać przez najkrótszą trasę czyli przez Polskę).  Dziewczyna obawia się, że na polskich granicach będą ogromne kolejki dlatego chciałaby jechać drugą trasą.

**2.** Czy oprócz paszportu potrzebuję jeszcze jakieś dokumenty? Pewnie muszę jeszcze wykupić ubezpieczenie turystyczne? Auto jest na ukraińskich numerach, OC i zielona karta jest.

**3.** Czy w Ukrainie do tej pory panuje godzina policyjna, podczas której nie można podróżować? Jeśli tak czy jest to w całej Ukrainie czy tylko bliżej linii frontu? 

**4.** Czy do przekroczenia granicy potrzebuję mieć ze sobą jakąś gotówkę? Jeśli tak to ile żeby przepuścili nas na granicy (pomijając fakt, że pieniądze u nas będą bo za coś musimy jeść i pić przez ten czas).

**5.** Droga powrotna, busem czy pociągiem? Z tego co patrzyliśmy to pociąg z Mikołajowa do chociażby Warszawy / Pragi nie kursuje bez przesiadek, chyba że ktoś wie coś więcej i mógłby pomóc. Ja osobiście obawiam się jechać pociągiem na taki dystans ze względu na doświadczenia z naszymi liniami kolejowymi. Niewiele razy jeździłem i praktycznie za każdym razem były jakieś opóźnienia a nie chciałbym potem w połowie trasy myśleć gdzie spać i szukać nowych biletów.

**6.** Gdzie jeszcze można zadać powyższe pytania żeby otrzymać najlepiej odpowiedź od osób, które podróżowały podobną trasą?

"Polska, tak jak cała Europa musi się szykować do wojny.","Wiem że to może brzmieć alarmistycznie no bo jak to tak żyjemy w Europie, w NATO, co takiego może nam zagrażać?  
Otóż sprawy generalnie nie mają się dobrze a nasze ostatnie wybory są bodaj jedynym pozytywnym aspektem ostatnich lat.    
Europa jest niebywale słaba militarnie, Trump prawdopodobnie zostanie wybrany w wyborach po czym co obiecuje właściwie zlikwiduje nato.     
Najsilnijsza armia jest w tej chwili w Ukrainie i ma szansę zostać unicestwiona bez wsparcia z zewnątrz. Tam teraz właśnie rozstrzyga się nasz los i czy będziemy siedzieć w okopach za  kilka lat w jakimś Pcimiu.   
Właściwie najlepiej byłoby przyjąć że wojna już trwa a my możemy jeszcze ją wygrać nie tocząc ani jednej bitwy na swoim terytorium.   
Problem w tym że co powinno się robić a co się robi to dwie różne rzeczy. Zwykła ludzka głupota i krótkowzroczność a może ograniczenia polityki sprawiają że powoli ale wytrwale zmierzamy do sytuacji w której Polska po raz kolejny będzie obszarem wojny. (Jakoś tak zawsze nam to wychodzi ciekawe czemu.)   
Europa już dawno nie jest jakąś silną jednością, w połowie krajów jest silna partią złożona z kremlowskich agentów. Orban chluba KGB torpeduje wszystko. Nie można liczyć że ktokolwiek nas obroni w razie czego albo będzie przestrzegać jakiś traktatów. Będą kłótnie, weta, thoughts and prayers, ktoś zrobi nawet kampanie wyborczą na niepomaganiu Polsce. Może jakiś rasizm wpadnie.   
Taki jest najgorszy scenariusz i wcale nie jest mało prawdopodobny jeśli będą odpowiednie warunki które dynamicznie się rozwijają w tym kierunku.   
Załóżmy że unikniemy tej wojny. Ukraina wygra, odzyska tereny, wejdzie do UE nawet. To da nam jakieś 20-30 lat wytchnenia zanim wejdzie katastrofa klimatyczna I klęska głodu/migracji (polityko zależne). Tak poważny kryzys nigdy nie dzieje się w pustce.

Bardzo ciekawy wywiad ministra spraw zagranicznych Ukrainy Dmytro Kuleby,"Link podam na samym dole. Niestety po angielsku ale Google Translate można przetłumaczyć w razie czego. 

Ciekawi mnie jedno. O który to kraj chodziło. Polska, Niemcy a może Francja? Mam na myśli ten kawałek rozmowy.

- Pierwszego dnia wojny, 24 lutego, ambasador Ukrainy w bardzo wpływowym kraju europejskim udał się do biura sekretarza stanu jakiegoś ministerstwa i powiedział: „Pomóżcie nam, wojna się rozpoczęła. Pomóżcie nam w tym i tamtym.""  Ta osoba uśmiechnęła się współczująco i odpowiedziała: „Mój drogi, bądźmy szczerzy, dlaczego mamy Ci pomagać, jeśli wszystko się skończy za maksymalnie 48 godzin i nadejdzie nowa rzeczywistość”.  To specyficzny epizod, który miał miejsce w niezwykle wpływowym kraju UE.  W ciągu następnych trzech dni widzieliśmy radykalne zmiany…

Wydarzenia ostatnich dni każą mi myśleć, że demonstracja ta miała przerodzić się w prowokację, której apogeum miało być aresztowanie Wąsika i Kamińskiego na oczach tłumu, przed kamerami. Jeśli tak rzeczywiście było, to decyzja Hołowni o przeniesieniu obrad na przyszły tydzień wydaje mi się trafiona, choć w pierwszym odruchu uznałem ją za uległość. Mam nadzieję, że chodziło jednak o rozbrojenie bomby.


👉 Wąsik i Kamiński już siedzą, ale sytuacja jest dalej napięta. Ich przedwczorajsze zatrzymanie w Pałacu Prezydenckim jest dokładnie taką sytuacją, o jakiej pisałem w lutym zeszłego roku. Tzn., że PiS tak zaognił sytuację, że nowy rząd musiał użyć siły, co dało pisowskiej propagandzie paliwo do odpalenia narracji o ""zamachu na demokrację"" i ""dyktaturze"". 
(Czy eksperci śmieszkujący z nadużywania tego słowa wobec rządów PiS już się wypowiedzieli? Dla kolegi pytam.)


👉 Ta narracja została już podchwycona przez amerykańską skrajną prawicę. O zamachu mówił nawet Alex Jones (przedstawiać nie trzeba) czy znany alt-rightowiec Michael Savage. Steve Bannon powiedział w swoim programie War Room, że mamy do czynienia z ""globalistycznym przewrotem"", a ""Polska jest mikrokosmosem, pokazującym co się stanie globalnie"". Jego gość Jack Posobiec twierdzi, że rząd PiS był ""kolcem w boku"" Merkel, globalistów i ""aparatczyków z Brukseli"". Ale trzy tygodnie temu ""globaliści"" przeprowadzili zamach stanu (tak tak). A Tusk to w ogóle ""zastępca Merkel"". Aha, no i po raz pierwszy od 1989 mamy więźniów politycznych. A ludzie są ""out on the streets"" - to chyba chodzi o te mikroprotesty o uwolnienie obu typów.
Brzmi śmiesznie, wiem. Ale pamiętajmy, że mówimy o ruchu politycznym, który stoi za próbą puczu w Waszyngtonie 6 stycznia 2021. Trumpiści jak najbardziej mają w Polsce swoją odnogę, o której można poczytać np. na oko press.


👉 Tymczasem pisowscy propagandziści już pokazują, że ""barierek miało nie być, a są"", podgrzewając dodatkowo atmosferę. Oprócz tego, od jakiegoś czasu coraz głośniej mówią, że rząd nie ma legitymizacji do rządzenia, że konieczny jest ""reset"", nowe wybory, nowe otwarcie. 
Czyli wiecie, PiS po prostu akceptuje demokratyczny wynik wyborów, tak jak przewidywał Twój Kolega Symetrysta.


👉 Do meritum. Wprawdzie decyzja Hołowni mogła jakoś rozbroić nastroje, nadal nie można wykluczyć, że po 16 dojdzie do... czegoś. Że zostanie przekroczona granica fizycznej przemocy. Jeśli przyjmujemy, że PiSowi mogło chodzić o taką ustawkę z Kamińskim i Wąsikiem, nie możemy wykluczyć, że mogą urządzić taką z kimś innym. Nie potrzeba wiele - jeden idiota, który kogoś zaatakuje może wystarczyć. Nie muszę wyjaśniać, jak to będzie wyglądało, prawda? Jako okoliczność bardziej hipotetyczną dodam, że przecież zmiana rządu miała miejsce ledwie miesiąc temu, więc nie wiem jak Wy, ale ja tam tej policji nie jestem w tej sytuacji pewien.


👉 Dodajmy na koniec, że sprowokowanie takiego incydentu może być po prostu inspirowane z zewnątrz. To żadna paranoja, od kilku lat wiemy, że Kreml opłacał za pośrednictwem Aleksandra Usowskiego dokładnie tego typu akcje, tyle że wtedy wymierzone  relacje polsko-ukraińskie. Okazuje się, że sprowokowanie protestu, ataku lub zniszczenia cmentarza kosztuje od kilkuset do kilku tysięcy dolarów. Mało.


👉 Zatem bądźcie czujni i uważni. Jeśli dziś po południu pod Sejmem wydarzy się... coś... uważajcie, by nie dać się ponieść emocjom, bo dokładnie o to chodzi. Uważam za uzasadnione stwierdzenie, że Prezesowi może o to chodzić. Uważam również, że może o to chodzić ludziom, nad którymi Prezes niekoniecznie panuje. Wreszcie może o to chodzić, ekhem ekhem, obcym siłom, którym zawsze na rękę jest destabilizowanie sytuacji wewnętrznej w Polsce, dolewanie oliwy do ognia, podkręcanie polaryzacji. A jeśli w bonusie punkty straci demokratyczny i prozachodni rząd, a zyska autorytarny i antyzachodni PiS, to tylko lepiej. Dodajmy, że nie mówię o Słowacji.


👉 Mam głęboką nadzieję, że nic się nie stanie. Że pisiaki przyjdą, poprotestują, zrobią o tym materiał w Republice, po czym rozejdą się do domów. I że nie będzie ich zbyt wielu. Niestety, widzę też zbieg różnych czynników, które mogą prowadzić do opisanego powyżej scenariusza.

coraz trudniej mi myśleć jakkolwiek pozytywnie.,"przepraszam z góry za ten post, ale to pewnie już będzie ostatni mój komentarz/post tutaj, przez jakiś czas przynajmniej, bo muszę sobie odpuścić czytanie reddita na jakiś czas, za bardzo mnie to stresuje.

anyway.

boję się bardzo.

żyję w ataku paniki 24/7. boję się wyłączyć TV, boję się iść spać. nie jestem w stanie robić czegokolwiek poza oglądaniem i czytaniem wiadomości.

boję się, że będzie wojna też u nas. albo w ogóle światowa. albo atomowa. albo że coś sie z tymi elektrowaniami jądrowymi stanie bo tam siedzą wojska rosyjskie i terroryzują personel. nie chce żeby amerykanie decydowali że Polska daje samoloty, bo jakby co to potem na nas sie to odbije i nas wciągnie w konflikt. 

ale pod wieloma informacjami na Onecie są odnośniki do Twittera, i ja raka dostaje od czytania Amerykańców wypowiadających się w tej kwestii, na co mogą sobie pozwolić bo to jest daleko od nich i czują, że ich to nie dotyczy. więc łatwo im mówić, że NATO powinno ""coś zrobić"". 

nie wiem czy Ukraina ma szanse pokonać Rosjan. raczej nie. no i co będzie? jak Rosja zajmie Ukraine to Polska bedzie miała granice z nimi + Białorusią, i bedziemy przez lata żyć w lęku i że na nas napadną. a i tak już wszyscy mówią, że jak Putinowi uda się zająć Ukraine to to bedzie dopiero pierwszy krok i będzie chciał iść dalej. Macron, Scholz, typ z Izraela, typ z Turcji, wszyscy próbują z tym Putinem gadać a on klepie dalej swoje jak mantre, nic nie chce się ugiąć. nawet mimo tego, że Ukraina sie tak broni, świat się od niego odwraca, Rosjanie nawet protestują, sankcje pogrążają kraj, wielkie fimy sie zawijają ze swoimi biznesami - wszystko to w dupie ma. więc pewnie Zachód w końcu będzie musiał iść na jakieś ustępstwa, aby zapobiec dalszym działaniom wojennym na cywilach. i wtedy Putin dostanie sygnał, że może robić co chce, bo nawet jak ktoś mu najpierw mówi ""nie"" to wystarczy potem odpowiednio mocno przycisnąć. 

nie mam siły żyć w takim strachu. próbowałam odciąć się od mediów, ale nie umiem. cokolwiek robię - czy próbuję oglądać serial, czy słuchać podcastu, czy grać, ciągle w głowie mam myśli, że mogę stracić to życie które teraz mam, i strach jest we mnie cały czas.

mam koleżankę w Austrii i mega jej zazdroszcze. chciałabym być teraz w neutralnym kraju gdzieś daleko. z drugiej strony też wstydzę się, że tak myślę, bo jak się działy inby na Krymie, w Gruzji, czy Syrii, to dla mnie też to wtedy było ""gdzieś daleko"" i się tak mocno nie przejmowałam. może to karma. 

boję się też, że moja firma (zagraniczna) może uzna, że Polska jest niebezpiecznym krajem, i zdecydują sie zamknąć nasz oddział. 

rozważam, czy nie skończyć ze sobą po prostu.

Czy wyjazd do Holandii na studia ma sens?,"Pytam jako licealistka. Wymienie czynniki, ktore sprawily, ze o tym mysle:

1) Mowi sie, ze polskie uczelnie to zlo. W sensie, chca samej kasy od uczniow albo kaza wkuwac sama teorie, przy czym poziom jest niski. W ogole sprawdzajac opinie google masy uczelni, mnostwo bylo tragicznych np wykladowcy znecaja sie. Chociaz zdaje sobie sprawe, ze tak moze byc wszedzie. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Ale slyszalam lepsze rzeczy o uczelniach w Holandii.

2)W Polsce nie ma za bardzo kierunkow, na ktore bym najbardziej chciala pojsc. Myslalam nad UX designem i architektura od strony designu (nie inzynierii, bez fizyki). AI na Uni of Amsterdam tez kusi w sumie. 
Nie wiem jak jest tam, ale w Polsce jak ktos potrzebuje grafika to zazwyczaj bierze kogos najtanszego (tak sie mowi)

3)Chec poznania nowego kraju, ludzi o roznych narodowosciach (mozna wreszcie wykorzystac znajomosc j.ang., jeej)

4)Slyszalam, ze zarabia sie dobrze w stosunku do wydatkow nawet jako mlody student, nawet pracujac tylko w weekendy (jak to prawda to zajebiscie). Jest ten kryzys mieszkaniowy, ale w Polsce jest duza inflacja.

Polecialabym z chlopakiem. I nie bralabym pomocy finansowej od rodzicow (w sensie, musialabym tam zarabiac sama, nie jestem bogata). 

Nie wiem czy taki pomysl na studia poza Polska tuz po maturze jest szalony. W koncu wiekszosc osob zostaje w Polsce. Nie mam tam zadnej rodziny/znajomych. Nie znam nikogo, kto studiuje za granica. Jestem mloda i bez doswiadczenia zyciowego (a fajnie je nabyc studiujac).

Chcielibyśmy aktywnie rozwijać kontakty gospodarcze z Rosją i Chinami, ponieważ jest u was dynamika rozwoju, nie tak jak w umierającej UE.

Rosja żadnego kraju nie podbiła. To myśmy cały czas atakowali Rosję – powiedział jeden z liderów Konfederacji Janusz Korwin-Mikke.

"Rosyjski portal wzywa do ""denazyfikacji"" Polski (z Rzepy)","W artykule zatytułowanym ""»Hiena« Europy Polska wciąga świat w trzecią wojnę światową"" rosyjski portal pravda.ru pisze, że Polacy nie wyciągnęli wniosków z historii, najwyraźniej chcą czwartego rozbioru i że Polska to kraj, który trzeba ""zdenazyfikować"".

Autorką tekstu opublikowanego przez portal pravda.ru jest Liubow Stepuszowa. Jej artykuł odnosi się do wizyty, którą we wtorek w Kijowie złożyli premier Mateusz Morawiecki, wicepremier Jarosław Kaczyński oraz szefowie rządów Czech i Słowenii, Petr Fiala i Janez Janša. Przywódcy spotkali się m.in. z prezydentem Wołodymyrem Zełenskim i premierem Denysem Szmyhalem. Na konferencji prasowej prezes PiS powiedział, że na terytorium Ukrainy ""potrzebna jest misja pokojowa, humanitarna NATO i być może jeszcze innych organizacji, ale osłonięta zbrojnie"".

- Ukraina jest państwem suwerennym. Jeżeli zgodzi się na taką misję, to to zupełnie wystarczy, to w świetle prawa międzynarodowego będzie całkowite dopuszczalne i w żadnym wypadku nie będzie żadnym casus belli - podkreślił wicepremier.

- To apel wicepremiera Kaczyńskiego do całego wolnego świata o wypracowanie takiego rozwiązania, które pozwoliłoby w sposób realny zahamować agresję rosyjską - powiedział szef KPRM, tłumacząc słowa prezesa PiS Jarosława Kaczyńskiego, który w Kijowie mówił o potrzebie utworzenia misji pokojowej. - Nikt nie mówi o zbrojnej interwencji - zastrzegł Michał Dworczyk.

W tekście Liubow Stepuszowa wyraża wątpliwość, czy spotkanie delegacji z Polski, Czech i Słowenii z władzami Ukrainy rzeczywiście miało miejsce w Kijowie, ale nie przedstawia żadnych dowodów, by miało być inaczej. Autorka rosyjskiego portalu nie zgadza się z opinią, że misja pokojowa, o której mówił Jarosław Kaczyński, nie byłaby powodem do wojny Rosji z NATO, ponieważ - w jej ocenie - rozpoczęcie misji doprowadziłaby do bezpośredniego kontaktu między siłami państw Sojuszu Północnoatlantyckiego ""i Rosji, a ogólniej rzecz biorąc, Organizacji Układu o Bezpieczeństwie Zbiorowym"".

""Polscy politycy wzięli się za rzucanie słowami, które w obecnych warunkach prowadzą do eskalacji. Historia niczego Polaków nie nauczyła, oni najwyraźniej chcą czwartego rozbioru Polski lub po prostu samozniszczenia"" - czytamy w tekście.

""Polska zawsze była »hieną« Europy, jak obrazowo wyraził to Winston Churchill"" - twierdzi Liubow Stepuszowa. W jej tekście padają zarzuty, jakoby Polacy na Ukrainie w 1920 r. dokonywali pogromów ludności żydowskiej oraz masowych egzekucji. Inwazję wojsk sowieckich na Polskę w 1939 r. publicystka pravdy.ru nazywa ""wyzwoleniem"" i niezgodnie z prawdą pisze, że gdy wojska ZSRR weszły we wrześniu na teren Polski, to ""de iure"" takiego państwa jak RP już nie było.

Wicepremier Ukrainy, Ołha Stefaniszyna informując o aktualnej sytuacji w oblężonym Mariupolu stwierdziła, że Rosjanie otwierają ogień do Ukraińców z zajętego wcześniej szpitala.

Autorka rosyjskiego portalu ocenia, że zmiany granic Polski, do których doszło w wyniku II wojny światowej były dla RP korzystne (Polska w wyniku II wojny światowej straciła ok. 1/3 część przedwojennego terytorium na rzecz ZSRR - red.). ""Można powiedzieć, że dzisiejsza Polska to kraj imienia Józefa Wissarionowicza Stalina. Ale Polska tego nie docenia, ona uważa terytorium Ukrainy za swoją kolonię i gotowa jest jak hiena żywić się jego »ostatkami«.

"Sytuacja na Ukrainie, a poparcie dla PiS / Konfederacji","Zastanawiam się jak obecna sytuacja wpłynie na sondaże PiS i Konfederacji. Wiem, że konflikty i wojny zwykle sprzyjają partiom rządzącym, ale co stanie się kiedy sytuacja się rozwiąże i kurz opadnie?

Czy w momencie Ukraina gdy walczy o życie, prosi o przyjęcie do UE/NATO, świat zachodu się jednoczy, a nawet Niemcy postanowili grać ostro pomimo powiązań biznesowych z Rosją, czy polskie partie tak wrogo nastawione do UE mają szanse znaleźć posłuch?

"Moja opinia. Zgodźcie się lub nie, ale zajmijcie jakieś stanowisko.","Ukraina została zaatakowana przez Rosję tak jak Polska w '39 przez Hitlera. Co do tego nie ma żadnych wątpliwości. Putin, podobnie jak Hitler, pozwalał sobie na odcinanie fragmentów tortu bez żadnych większych reperkusji ze strony zachodu. Rozumiem argumenty o coraz większym rozpychaniu się NATO, ale są marne w porównaniu do tego co robil Putin i jego Rosja. Jestem naprawdę zachwycony zrywem Polaków jeśli chodzi o pomoc Ukrainie, ale... Tam wciąż giną cywile. Zachód i NATO i tak zrobiło więcej możnaby sie spodziewać. Więcej niż dla nas zrobił ktokolwiek w 1939 r. Mam jednak niesmak, bo tak jak te 83. lata temu nasze wojsko dzielnie biło się i trwało po to, by ktoś w końcu przyszedł nam z pomocą, tak teraz biją się Ukraińcy. Wiem, że nie są w NATO i w UE. Nie zmienia to jednak faktu, ze giną tam niewinni ludzie, a cały świat się temu przygląda. Przygląda sie rzezi ludności cywilnej bojąc sie pierd...ąć pięścią w stół, w obawie przed zaostrzeniem sytuacji. Ale czy sytuacja nie wymaga takich czynów ? Czy bandyta nie powinien zostać powstrzymany bez względu na konsekwencje ? Naszym mottem jest ""Za wolność naszą i waszą"". Jak uważacie ?

"R/Polacy, pomóżcie usunąć polskojęzycznego propagandzistę kremla z Youtube","Wiem, że na Youtube jest sporo ruskiej propagandy, ale kanał [Dostawcy Wrażeń](https://www.youtube.com/@dostawcy/videos) jest już całkiem spory i z jakiegoś powodu dalej nie został zrzucony z YT, wciąż generuje twórcy przychody. Kanał został założony miesiąc przed inwazją Rosji na Ukrainę, jest bardzo aktywny i regularnie wrzuca content, który w 99% to próba obrzydzenia Ukraińców Polakom. Prowadzi go mieszkający w Polsce Rosjanin. Filmy mają spory zasięg w szurskich kręgach, mamy tutaj same klasyki ruskiej propagandy w Polsce, na przykład:

Do tego oczywiście masa filmów mówiących o Rzezi Wołyńskiej, o nazistach i ćpunach na Ukrainie oraz o tym, że sankcje nałożone na Rosję nie działają.

Trzeba wzmacniać zdolności obronne Polski,"Cześć,

wracając do tematu rakiety. Nasze systemy obrony powietrznej nie zareagowały na czas. Dlaczego?! Czytałem wypowiedzi ekspertów wojskowych, którzy mówili, że żadna armia nie dysponuje systemem obrony powietrznej, który chroni terytorium całego kraju, a broni obiekty infrastruktury krytycznej. Osobiście uważa, to niczego nie usprawiedliwia. Niewinni cywile zginęli! Zwłaszcza, że nie jesteśmy zaangażowani militarnie.

Co najsmutniejsze, ta tragedia będzie traktowana jako wypadek. Nikt jednak nie powiedział, że sytuacja już się nie powtórzy. Jednym z zadań wojska jest bezpieczeństwo mieszkańców. Niestety, nie obyło się bez ofiar…

Czy można było uniknąć tej tragedii? Być może gdyby rząd i Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej zwróciły uwagę nie tylko na modernizację radzieckiego sprzętu wojskowego i zakup zagranicznego uzbrojenia, ale także na rozwój własnego przemysłu zbrojeniowego. Naprawdę mocne państwo to kraj z potężnym przemysłem obronnym, który gwarantuje polityczną i technologiczną niezależność.

Oczywiście zawsze możemy liczyć na broń z Stanów Zjednoczonych, a także z Wielkiej Brytanii. Mam nadzieję, że nasi przyjaciele nie obrażą się, nie musimy być od nikogo zależni i nikt nam nie będzie dyktował. Trzeba rozwijać własną budowę czołgów nowej generacji, opracowywać nowe systemy obrony powietrznej i przeciwrakietowej itp.

Tak, będzie to wymagało wielkich inwestycji. Pozytywne efekty nie będą widoczne od razu. Niewielka cena w porównaniu z przyszłością kraju. Potężny przemysł wojskowy pomaga podnieść zdolności obronne, a produkty wojskowe mogą być oferowane na rynku międzynarodowym. Dla niektórych może się to wydawać futurystyczne…

Na zakończenie chciałbym podkreślić, że należy zwrócić szczególną uwagę na kwestię bezpieczeństwa.",Polska,2022-12-05 09:09:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/zd1zcv/trzeba_wzmacniać_zdolności_obronne_polski/,"Trzeba wzmacniać zdolności obronne Polski Cześć,

Doniesienia z putinowskiej Polski - Refleksja,"refleksja

Refleksja o faktach. Nie tylko konkretnych, choć te w tym tekście też się pojawią, ale o faktach ogólnie. A dokładniej o tym, jak ich odrzucanie prowadzi nas na manowce. I czemu korzystają na tym populiści, dyktatorzy i inny kondukatorzy. Zaparzcie herbatkę, bo dłuższe czytanie.

👉 Zacznę od stwierdzenia banalnego, które jednak wydaje mi się w czasach post-prawdy i algorytmów mediów społecznościowych nieco zapomniane. Otóż jest tylko jeden zestaw faktów, bo fakty są wycinkami rzeczywistości, a tę mamy tylko jedną. Im więcej znamy faktów, tym lepiej znamy rzeczywistość. A im lepiej znamy rzeczywistość, tym skuteczniej możemy na nią reagować i ją zmieniać zgodnie z naszymi przewidywaniami. Amen.

👉 Reagować i zmieniać, czyli co? Czyli na przykład rozwiązywać problemy, z którymi się borykamy. By rozwiązać problem, musimy go najpierw rozpoznać. Czyli poznać fakty, które ten problem opisują. Dopiero wtedy możemy wymyślać rozwiązania, stawiać hipotezy, robić modele, przewidywać jakie działanie przyniesie oczekiwany skutek. Oczywiście, niektórzy z nas będą próbowali zmienić rzeczywistość na naszą niekorzyść (np. ustalą fakt, że nie masz w domu alarmu, by Ci ten dom okraść), ale istnienie takich ludzi również jest elementem rzeczywistości, czyli jest opisywalne faktami. ""Na świecie istnieją włamywacze"" - to fakt. ""Alarm w domu zmniejsza ryzyko włamania"" - też. Wiedząc te dwie rzeczy, możesz na nie reagować. Amen ponownie.

👉 Co to ma wspólnego z autokratami? Ano to, że autokrata to taki wielki włamywacz, który chce nam ukraść wolność lub pieniądze. A zwykle, bo naprawdę rzadko jest inaczej, wolność i pieniądze. By zabezpieczyć się przed zapędami autokraty, musimy wiedzieć co robi, co planuje, czym nam grożą jego decyzje, pomysły czy wizje. Musimy zatem znać możliwie dużo faktów na temat danego autokraty (a szerzej: każdej władzy), by mieć możliwość przewidywania jego działań i reagowania na nie. Musimy trzymać się rzeczywistości. Dlatego autokraci i inni populiści uwielbiają tę rzeczywistość zamulać, rozwadniać, wykręcać na wszystkie strony. Dlatego uwielbiają odrzucać fakty i oparte na nich rozumowanie. Uwielbiają i muszą.

👉 Przejdźmy do przykładu z polskiej polityki. Weźmy powszechnie dostępny fakt o aferze taśmowej: restauracja Sowa została założona przez ludzi z Grupy Radius. To żadna tajemnica, wisi toto w KRS [1]. Weźmy fakt drugi: szefem Radiusa jest facet, który był dyrektorem polskiej filii prowadzonego przez rosyjskie służby i mafię banku [2]. Weźmy trzeci fakt: kelnerzy z Sowy pracowali wcześniej w Lemongrassie, w którym też podsłuchiwano polityków, a która to knajpa została założona przez dyrektora finansowego polskiej filii Łukoilu oraz Rosjanina, który już dekadę wcześniej pracował dla Siemona Mogilewicza, a także przed którym ABW ostrzegało polityków przed 2005 rokiem [3]. Oraz, że po zamknięciu Lemongrassa, sprzedano go spółce córce Łukoilu, po czym ponownie jakiemuś tajemniczemu Rosjaninowi, który ją zamknął. Fakt czwarty: Marek Falenta miał kilkudziesięciomilionowy dług u Rosjan z koncernu KTK, którego to długu KTK nigdy nie odebrało, choć państwo polskie dało im taką możliwość. Fakt piąty: wiceszef CBŚP Rafał Derlatka, który nadzorował śledztwo podsłuchowe, całkowicie ignorując leżące na ulicy rosyjskie wątki, dwa lata po wybuchu afery znalazł pracę w KTK [4]. Chyba nikt nie kwestionuje, że ta afera pomogła Partii zdobyć władzę.

👉 To są fakty. Mogą nam się podobać lub nie, ale to jest część rzeczywistości, w której żyjemy. Celowo nie wymieniłem wyżej ŻADNEGO fragmentu opartego o zeznania, hipotezy czy domysły, choćbym uważał je za wysoce uzasadnione i bardzo prawdopodobne. Na podstawie tych faktów możemy budować teorie. Jedni, w tym ja, powiedzą, że szansa na to, że ze wszystkich setek luksusowych restauracji w Warszawie, Falenta zlecił nagrania akurat w tej, którą założyli ludzie Radiusa - jest niemal zerowa. Że szansa, iż ci sami kelnerzy pracowali w innej knajpie, również z bliskimi rosyjskimi koneksjami - również. Inni powiedzą, że to jednak przypadek, że może te powiązania nie są aż tak jednoznaczne. I o tym możemy dyskutować, do czego wszystkich zachęcam.

👉 Problem w tym, że Partia w ogóle nie prowadzi z nikim dyskusji o interpretacji tych faktów, tylko po prostu te fakty odrzuca. Gdy ktoś powie publicznie: ""hej, ale Sowę założyli ludzie Radiusa!"", Partia odpowiada: ""ta, ehe, i Ruskie pomogły dojść do władzy PiSowi, który teraz wysyła broń na Ukrainę, walnij się w łeb"". Serio, to jest dokładnie narracja partyjnego agitpropu. No tak, wysyła, to jest fakt. No ale Sowa i Radius to też fakt. Różni je to, że NIKT nie neguje, że Partia pomaga militarnie Ukrainie, ani że ta pomoc utrudnia Putinowi zwycięstwo. Ale CAŁA PARTIA neguje wymienione wyżej fakty o aferze podsłuchowej.

👉 I mamy taką sytuację, że jedna strona podaje fakty, wokół których buduje pewną teorię. A druga strona buduje teorię przeciwną do tamtej, po czym odrzuca - to jest kluczowe - nie przeciwną teorię, tylko fakty, na której ją oparto. Przekładając na banalny przykład: Jaś tłumaczy Stasiowi, że istnieje grawitacja, więc upuszczony kamień spadnie w dół. Staś twierdzi, że puszczony kamień poleci w górę, więc - konkluduje Staś - grawitacji nie ma. Przepraszam, ale dokładnie to robi Samuel Pereira i inni mediaworkerzy reżimu. A nawet gdy przeciwstawiają powyższym faktom jakiś inny, np. pomoc militarną dla Ukrainy, to zamiast próbować połączyć te niekwestionowalne fakty w jakąś spójną teorię, po prostu odrzucają fakty, które im nie pasują.

👉 A to tylko przykład taśmowy, jest ich więcej. Prezes sam napisał we wspomnieniach, że na początku transformacji przez ponad rok spotykał się z radzieckim agentem - fakt. ""Ta, PiS prorosyjski, co za szuria"" - narracja, która ma ten fakt odrzucić. Partyjni notable wielokrotnie spotykali się ze skrajnie prawicowymi politykami z całej Europy, wśród których jest wielu jawnych miłośników Putina - fakt. ""A co z Sikorskim, który palił papierosy z Ławrowem, hę?"" - whataboutism, który wybić Ci ten fakt z głowy Wspomniany szef Radiusa zamienił się domami z Adamem Glapińskim, ewidentnie zaniżając wartość podarowywanej mu rezydencji - fakt. ""To jest brudny atak niepolskich mediów na konstytucyjny organ jakim jest NBP"" - narracja, która nijak nie odnosi się do tego faktu i przekierowuje ostrze ataku w drugą stronę. Ziobro może w każdej chwili przerwać dowolne śledztwo prokuratury - fakt. ""Prokuratura działa niezależnie"" - opowieść, która nawet nie próbuje z tym faktem polemizować.

👉 I tak dalej, i tym podobne. Media Karnowskich należą do senatora Biereckiego. Media Sakiewicza należą do Prezesa. Propartyjne media są utrzymywane przez spółki Skarbu Państwa. TVP jest utrzymywana z naszych pieniędzy, a Partia ma kontrolę nad jej władzami. Reforma Ziobry nie usprawniła działania sądów. Większość sędziów nie pracowała w PRL, więc nie trzeba ich ""dekomunizować"". Proponowana przez Ziobrę ustawa spłaszczająca sądy, pozwoli mu wymienić setki niezależnych sędziów na swoich. Trybunał Konstytucyjny jest obsadzony nielegalnymi sędziami. Podobnie jak KRS. Polska może w każdej chwili odmrozić środki z KPO, ale Partia tego nie robi. Ludzie Ziobry z SP niemal codziennie nawołują do polexitu. Zbieżność antyzachodnich narracji TVP z kremlowską jest bardzo duża. Piszę z głowy, tylko o rzeczach, które wiemy na pewno. O faktach. O rzeczywistości.

👉 Partia nie rozmawia o żadnym z tych faktów. Bo gdyby tak zrobiła, gdyby przeprowadziła uczciwą i racjonalną dyskusję, musiałaby ją przegrać. Bo taka dyskusja opierałaby się na faktach, a te są jakie są. Zamiast tego, Partia te fakty ukrywa, ignoruje, rozmywa, albo w sposób zupełnie absurdalny “odrzuca” jakimiś swoimi narracjami. Partia nam mówi, że ona uważa, że kamień poleci w górę, więc grawitacji nie ma.

👉 To niestety działa. Wróćmy jeszcze na chwilę do afery taśmowej. Konkurs: ręka w górę, kto z Was przeczytał wszystkie opublikowane przez Ziobrę zeznania? Nikt? Prawie nikt? No więc ja przeczytałem i uprzejmie donoszę, że była to lektura niezwykle męcząca. Na kilku stronach zeznający opowiada o wielu różnych sprawach, z których każda jest wielopoziomową intrygą polityczno-biznesowo-przestępczą. To naprawdę trudno ogarnąć. A ja to przeczytałem i próbowałem pojąć. Dlatego nie dziwi mnie zupełnie, że tzw. opinia publiczna (czyli my wszyscy) po prostu się w tym zgubiliśmy. A jak się zgubiliśmy, to straciliśmy z oczu fakty, tonąc w detalach. I nagle zamiast próbować dojść prawdy o udziale Rosjan w aferze, mamy zupełnie fałszywy spór o to, które zeznanie jest prawdziwe. Pamiętacie siedem technik kremlowskiej dezinformacji, o których pisałem tu: [5]? To jest technika E jak Exhaust, czyli Wyczerpanie. Zalej przeciwnika setkami nic nie znaczących detali, by się w nich zgubił, przekieruj dyskusję na jakieś drobiazgi, a sedno problemu zniknie samo.

👉 To jest dokładnie to co Ziobro zrobił z tymi zeznaniami. Zwróćcie uwagę, że on nie powiedział wprost “Rosjanie nie mieli z tym nic wspólnego”. On tylko tak zamotał, byśmy wszyscy machnęli ręką i uznali, że to jest nie do ogarnięcia dla prostych ludzi. I to zadziałało. Radius? Jaki Radius? To też mówię z autopsji, dokładnie tak wyglądała moja potyczka z Pereirą na Twitterze.

👉 Ktoś powie: ok, to tylko zwykłe kłamstwo, politycy kłamią, nic niezwykłego. Nie. To jest dokładnie to, co chcą byśmy myśleli. W momencie, w którym tak mówisz, odrzucasz fakty i obiektywną prawdę jako takie. Jeśli wszyscy kłamią, to znaczy, że nie ma obiektywnej prawdy, są tylko narracje. A skoro tak, to najlepiej usiąść na dupie i nic nie robić. A gdy usiądziesz, to ci, którzy zamiast uprawiać zwykłą politykę, chcą okraść Cię z państwa, będą mogli to robić bez przeszkód. A że w budowaniu narracji to oni są akurat najlepsi, to jeszcze będziesz przekonany, że mają rację. Powyższe dwa zdanie nieźle opisują znaczną część elektoratu Partii. Przecież Prezes i Ziobro wprost im mówią: “przejmiemy sądy, nie będziecie mieli uczciwych i niezależnych sądów, sędziowie będą nasi, będą kryli nasze przestępstwa i pomogą nam rządzić wiecznie” - a jakaś ¼ Polaków bije temu brawo, bo sprytni macherzy od PR-u dobrze dobrali przekaz, umieścili w nim odpowiednio dużo “postkomunizmu”, “przywracania godności” i “zepsutych elit”, by ludziom ta opowieść podobała się bardziej od tej o niezależności sądownictwa i trójpodziale władzy. Wiecie, tej nudnej, z WOS-u.

👉 Ale czemu oni to robią? Wszak, mimo wszystko, politykom w każdym kraju zdarza się kłamać, czasem wręcz bezczelnie. Ale większość z nich jednak nie odrzuca samej idei obiektywnej prawdy. Mogą ukrywać fakty, przedstawiać je w korzystny sposób, budować na nich mało spójne teorie, ale jednak zgadzają się, wszyscy się zgadzamy, że gdzieś pod spodem jest jakaś Prawda. Tymczasem autokraci odrzucają samą prawdę. Różnica polega na tym, że normalni politycy w demokratycznych krajach, operują w granicach zapisanego prawa, grają według reguł funkcjonowania państwa (dokładnie na tym polega idea praworządności, którą Partia tak ochoczo odrzuca). Tymczasem autokrata chce zburzyć system i rządzić wiecznie. W tym celu musi posuwać się do “dużych kłamstw”. I nie może kłamać czasem, tylko cały czas, bo samo jądro sposobu jego rządzenia jest oparte na konieczności łamania prawa. Ale gdyby taki autokrata tylko kłamał, to szybciutko wyszłoby to na jaw, bo byłby każdego dnia punktowany przez niezależne media i instytucje, takie jak sądy, czy prokuratura.

👉 Znacznie lepsze rezultaty przynosi z kolei odrzucenie prawdy jako takiej. Zwróćcie uwagę, że Ziobro z nikim się nie kłóci na przykład o to, ilu polskich sędziów rzeczywiście jest “skażonych PRL-em”. Nie. On po prostu buduje opowieść, że polski wymiar sprawiedliwości to postkomunistyczna kasta (to jest to “duże kłamstwo”), z czego wynika, że postkomuniści rządzą całym krajem, postkomunistyczne są wszystkie elity, którym zdeprawowani za Jaruzelskiego sędziowie gwarantują bezkarność. Gdy ktoś udowadnia, że przeciętny polski sędzia jest przed 50-tką, że ci, którzy załapali się zawodowo na PRL to jakiś ułamek, Ziobro przedstawia to jako kontropowieść. Po prostu inne zdanie, nie opis rzeczywistości. Z rzeczywistością ciężko się kłócić. Z innym zdaniem można się kłócić do upadłego. Drugi konkurs: kto z Was jest tak na serio na bieżąco z całą rozgrywką Partii z sędziami? Prawie nikt, prawda? Ja ten temat śledzę w miarę dokładnie, a i tak za prawie każdym razem muszę sobie przypominać od nowa o co chodziło, kto kogo dyscyplinuje za co, który wyrok jest kwestionowany, która ustawa była nielegalna. To co ma myśleć statystyczny wyborca? Nic. Ma nie myśleć, tylko machnąć na to ręką i pozwolić Ziobrze działać dalej.

👉 Nie jest przypadkiem, że rosyjskie trolle i cała kremlowska propaganda, mocno angażują się nie tylko w przedstawianie swojej wersji świata, ale także w odrzucanie samej idei, że świat da się obiektywnie przedstawić. Puszczanie w obieg sprzecznych informacji jest nie tylko dopuszczalne, ale wręcz wskazane. Ruskie trolle mówią na przykład skrajnej prawicy na Zachodzie, że Ukrainą rządzą Żydzi, bo Zełeński jest z żydowskiej rodziny. Te same trolle (możliwe, że z innego piętra Fabryki Trolli Prigożyna) mówią lewicy, że Ukrainą rządzą neonaziści. Polakom mówi się, że Ukraińcy genetycznie nienawidzą Polaków, bo Wołyń. Węgrom, że Węgrów, bo Trianon. Ukraina jest jednocześnie państwem upadłym i sprawnym totalitaryzmem. NATO prowadzi z Rosją wojnę, ale równocześnie dopiero chce w tę wojnę wciągnąć swoich członków, na przykład Polskę. Ruskie trolle mówiły Amerykanom w 2016 roku, że Hillary Clinton to lewaczka, która chce zalać USA czarnoskórymi imigrantami. Chyba, że mówili do czarnoskórych wyborców - wtedy mówiono, że to przedstawicielka rasistowskiego establishmentu. Biedakom mówiono, że Clinton jest z obrzydliwie bogatych elit. Elitom, że to komunistka. Wszystkie te narracje nawzajem się wykluczają. I o to właśnie chodzi.

👉 Nie jest też przypadkiem, że Partia stosuje tę technikę, którą Piknik na skraju głupoty nazywa “wielonarracją”, cały czas. Prezes jeździ teraz po kraju i co chwila daje sprzeczny komunikat. Za wszelkie zło odpowiadają Niemcy. Albo Platforma, czyli jednak Polacy. Albo Bruksela, czyli wszyscy Europejczycy. Albo elgiebety, czyli jednak niektórzy europejczycy. Albo sędziowie, czyli niektórzy Polacy. Unia jest lewackim eksperymentem feministek, ale zachowuje się wobec Polski po faszystowsku. Pieniądze z KPO? Proszę bardzo. Potrzebujemy ich, ale jednak nie, to dużo, ale jednak mało, stać nas by ich nie mieć, ale jednak nie, jesteśmy gotowi na ustępstwa, ale nie sprzedamy suwerenności za garść srebrników, poszliśmy na ustępstwa, ale jednak stoimy twardo przy swoim, z UE chcemy rozmawiać, ale jednak “koniec tego dobrego”. Idealnym przykładem jest macierewiczowa dezinformacja wokół Smoleńska, gdzie naliczono bodaj 30 całkowicie sprzecznych teorii, z których większość zaprzeczała prawom fizyki. Jaka jest prawda? W tym świecie jest to pytanie bezzasadne. Właściwe brzmi: “po co Ci w ogóle prawda?”

👉 Stąd pojawiło się zjawisko symetryzmu, które jest rakiem debaty publicznej w każdym kraju. Stąd mamy ludzi, nie mówię tu o oczywistych płatnych trollach, którzy dla własnego spokoju ducha zrównują stojące po jednej stronie fakty, z budowanym w kontrze do nich narracjami i mówią rzeczy w stylu “kto wie, ci mówią tak, tamci inaczej, prawda leży po środku, pewnie znowu kłócą się o pieniądze”. Władcy tacy jak Prezes, Ziobro, Trump, Orban, Erdogan, a w wypadkach skrajnych Putin czy Xi Jinping, kochają takich ludzi, bo takimi ludźmi się bardzo prosto rządzi. Bowiem nie trzeba im nic tłumaczyć czy obiecywać, a także z niczego się przed nimi rozliczać. Wystarczy dać im dobry show. Taki, który lepiej zagra na ich emocjach. A Prezesi i Putinowie tego świata są w to zawsze lepsi od demokratów, bo robią taki show cały czas.

👉 “Wszyscy kradną, ale ci się dzielą” - mówimy o stereotypowym poglądzie wyborców Partii. Ale z pewnością macie znajomych i członków rodzin, którzy niekoniecznie kochają Partię, ale też już mają dość, pogubili się w tych niekończących się bataliach o TK, Sąd Najwyższy, KPO, niezależność sędziów, KRS itd., chcą już tylko spokoju, żeby ktoś już to zakończył i dał im zająć się swoimi sprawami. I wtedy na scenę wjeżdżają ci wszyscy watażkowie, którzy - to również element show - potrafią świetnie przedstawiać się jako jedyni sprawiedliwi, szeryfowie, którzy zaprowadzą porządek. Dlatego Trump obiecywał “osuszenie bagna”, Prezes “powstanie z kolan”, “przywrócenie godności” i “suwerenność”, Ziobro “zniszczenie uprzywilejowanej kasty”, Putin odrzucenie “jednobiegunowego świata” i “zachodniego imperializmu” itd. Nikt z nich nic z tego nie zrobił. Ale te obietnice są nadal atrakcyjne dla ludzi, którzy chcą prostych odpowiedzi na skomplikowane problemy. I im bardziej są oderwani od rzeczywistości, im bardziej zamykają oczy na fakty i odmawiają spokojnej ich analizy, tym chętniej uwierzą w takie baśniowe, ale bardzo wygodne psychologicznie, obietnice.

👉 Przyznam, że w całym zakłamaniu Partii, ten gwałt na intelekcie irytuje mnie najbardziej. A już zupełnie wkurwia mnie świadomość, że nawet gdy Partia odejdzie i sobie swoją głupią twarz rozwali, zostaną z nami miliony ludzi, których Prezes z Ziobrą zmienili już w totalnych nihilistów. Partia zniknie, oni będą, prawdopodobnie dalej przekonani, że wszyscy kłamią, nie ma prawdy, wartości to iluzja, nikomu nie można ufać. Aż ich zagospodaruje jakiś nowy klon Prezesa. Często pytacie mnie w komentarzach i wiadomościach “co robić?”. Cóż, zacząłbym od dotarcia do tych znajomych.

👉 Przejdźmy do przykładu z polskiej polityki. Weźmy powszechnie dostępny fakt o aferze taśmowej: restauracja Sowa została założona przez ludzi z Grupy Radius. To żadna tajemnica, wisi toto w KRS [1]. Weźmy fakt drugi: szefem Radiusa jest facet, który był dyrektorem polskiej filii prowadzonego przez rosyjskie służby i mafię banku [2]. Weźmy trzeci fakt: kelnerzy z Sowy pracowali wcześniej w Lemongrassie, w którym też podsłuchiwano polityków, a która to knajpa została założona przez dyrektora finansowego polskiej filii Łukoilu oraz Rosjanina, który już dekadę wcześniej pracował dla Siemona Mogilewicza, a także przed którym ABW ostrzegało polityków przed 2005 rokiem [3]. Oraz, że po zamknięciu Lemongrassa, sprzedano go spółce córce Łukoilu, po czym ponownie jakiemuś tajemniczemu Rosjaninowi, który ją zamknął. Fakt czwarty: Marek Falenta miał kilkudziesięciomilionowy dług u Rosjan z koncernu KTK, którego to długu KTK nigdy nie odebrało, choć państwo polskie dało im taką możliwość. Fakt piąty: wiceszef CBŚP Rafał Derlatka, który nadzorował śledztwo podsłuchowe, całkowicie ignorując leżące na ulicy rosyjskie wątki, dwa lata po wybuchu afery znalazł pracę w KTK [4]. Chyba nikt nie kwestionuje, że ta afera pomogła Partii zdobyć władzę.

👉 To są fakty. Mogą nam się podobać lub nie, ale to jest część rzeczywistości, w której żyjemy. Celowo nie wymieniłem wyżej ŻADNEGO fragmentu opartego o zeznania, hipotezy czy domysły, choćbym uważał je za wysoce uzasadnione i bardzo prawdopodobne. Na podstawie tych faktów możemy budować teorie. Jedni, w tym ja, powiedzą, że szansa na to, że ze wszystkich setek luksusowych restauracji w Warszawie, Falenta zlecił nagrania akurat w tej, którą założyli ludzie Radiusa - jest niemal zerowa. Że szansa, iż ci sami kelnerzy pracowali w innej knajpie, również z bliskimi rosyjskimi koneksjami - również. Inni powiedzą, że to jednak przypadek, że może te powiązania nie są aż tak jednoznaczne. I o tym możemy dyskutować, do czego wszystkich zachęcam.

👉 Problem w tym, że Partia w ogóle nie prowadzi z nikim dyskusji o interpretacji tych faktów, tylko po prostu te fakty odrzuca. Gdy ktoś powie publicznie: ""hej, ale Sowę założyli ludzie Radiusa!"", Partia odpowiada: ""ta, ehe, i Ruskie pomogły dojść do władzy PiSowi, który teraz wysyła broń na Ukrainę, walnij się w łeb"". Serio, to jest dokładnie narracja partyjnego agitpropu. No tak, wysyła, to jest fakt. No ale Sowa i Radius to też fakt. Różni je to, że NIKT nie neguje, że Partia pomaga militarnie Ukrainie, ani że ta pomoc utrudnia Putinowi zwycięstwo. Ale CAŁA PARTIA neguje wymienione wyżej fakty o aferze podsłuchowej.

👉 I mamy taką sytuację, że jedna strona podaje fakty, wokół których buduje pewną teorię. A druga strona buduje teorię przeciwną do tamtej, po czym odrzuca - to jest kluczowe - nie przeciwną teorię, tylko fakty, na której ją oparto. Przekładając na banalny przykład: Jaś tłumaczy Stasiowi, że istnieje grawitacja, więc upuszczony kamień spadnie w dół. Staś twierdzi, że puszczony kamień poleci w górę, więc - konkluduje Staś - grawitacji nie ma. Przepraszam, ale dokładnie to robi Samuel Pereira i inni mediaworkerzy reżimu. A nawet gdy przeciwstawiają powyższym faktom jakiś inny, np. pomoc militarną dla Ukrainy, to zamiast próbować połączyć te niekwestionowalne fakty w jakąś spójną teorię, po prostu odrzucają fakty, które im nie pasują.

👉 A to tylko przykład taśmowy, jest ich więcej. Prezes sam napisał we wspomnieniach, że na początku transformacji przez ponad rok spotykał się z radzieckim agentem - fakt. ""Ta, PiS prorosyjski, co za szuria"" - narracja, która ma ten fakt odrzucić. Partyjni notable wielokrotnie spotykali się ze skrajnie prawicowymi politykami z całej Europy, wśród których jest wielu jawnych miłośników Putina - fakt. ""A co z Sikorskim, który palił papierosy z Ławrowem, hę?"" - whataboutism, który wybić Ci ten fakt z głowy Wspomniany szef Radiusa zamienił się domami z Adamem Glapińskim, ewidentnie zaniżając wartość podarowywanej mu rezydencji - fakt. ""To jest brudny atak niepolskich mediów na konstytucyjny organ jakim jest NBP"" - narracja, która nijak nie odnosi się do tego faktu i przekierowuje ostrze ataku w drugą stronę. Ziobro może w każdej chwili przerwać dowolne śledztwo prokuratury - fakt. ""Prokuratura działa niezależnie"" - opowieść, która nawet nie próbuje z tym faktem polemizować.

👉 I tak dalej, i tym podobne. Media Karnowskich należą do senatora Biereckiego. Media Sakiewicza należą do Prezesa. Propartyjne media są utrzymywane przez spółki Skarbu Państwa. TVP jest utrzymywana z naszych pieniędzy, a Partia ma kontrolę nad jej władzami. Reforma Ziobry nie usprawniła działania sądów. Większość sędziów nie pracowała w PRL, więc nie trzeba ich ""dekomunizować"". Proponowana przez Ziobrę ustawa spłaszczająca sądy, pozwoli mu wymienić setki niezależnych sędziów na swoich. Trybunał Konstytucyjny jest obsadzony nielegalnymi sędziami. Podobnie jak KRS. Polska może w każdej chwili odmrozić środki z KPO, ale Partia tego nie robi. Ludzie Ziobry z SP niemal codziennie nawołują do polexitu. Zbieżność antyzachodnich narracji TVP z kremlowską jest bardzo duża. Piszę z głowy, tylko o rzeczach, które wiemy na pewno. O faktach. O rzeczywistości.

👉 Partia nie rozmawia o żadnym z tych faktów. Bo gdyby tak zrobiła, gdyby przeprowadziła uczciwą i racjonalną dyskusję, musiałaby ją przegrać. Bo taka dyskusja opierałaby się na faktach, a te są jakie są. Zamiast tego, Partia te fakty ukrywa, ignoruje, rozmywa, albo w sposób zupełnie absurdalny “odrzuca” jakimiś swoimi narracjami. Partia nam mówi, że ona uważa, że kamień poleci w górę, więc grawitacji nie ma.

👉 To niestety działa. Wróćmy jeszcze na chwilę do afery taśmowej. Konkurs: ręka w górę, kto z Was przeczytał wszystkie opublikowane przez Ziobrę zeznania? Nikt? Prawie nikt? No więc ja przeczytałem i uprzejmie donoszę, że była to lektura niezwykle męcząca. Na kilku stronach zeznający opowiada o wielu różnych sprawach, z których każda jest wielopoziomową intrygą polityczno-biznesowo-przestępczą. To naprawdę trudno ogarnąć. A ja to przeczytałem i próbowałem pojąć. Dlatego nie dziwi mnie zupełnie, że tzw. opinia publiczna (czyli my wszyscy) po prostu się w tym zgubiliśmy. A jak się zgubiliśmy, to straciliśmy z oczu fakty, tonąc w detalach. I nagle zamiast próbować dojść prawdy o udziale Rosjan w aferze, mamy zupełnie fałszywy spór o to, które zeznanie jest prawdziwe. Pamiętacie siedem technik kremlowskiej dezinformacji, o których pisałem tu: [5]? To jest technika E jak Exhaust, czyli Wyczerpanie. Zalej przeciwnika setkami nic nie znaczących detali, by się w nich zgubił, przekieruj dyskusję na jakieś drobiazgi, a sedno problemu zniknie samo.

👉 To jest dokładnie to co Ziobro zrobił z tymi zeznaniami. Zwróćcie uwagę, że on nie powiedział wprost “Rosjanie nie mieli z tym nic wspólnego”. On tylko tak zamotał, byśmy wszyscy machnęli ręką i uznali, że to jest nie do ogarnięcia dla prostych ludzi. I to zadziałało. Radius? Jaki Radius? To też mówię z autopsji, dokładnie tak wyglądała moja potyczka z Pereirą na Twitterze.

👉 Ktoś powie: ok, to tylko zwykłe kłamstwo, politycy kłamią, nic niezwykłego. Nie. To jest dokładnie to, co chcą byśmy myśleli. W momencie, w którym tak mówisz, odrzucasz fakty i obiektywną prawdę jako takie. Jeśli wszyscy kłamią, to znaczy, że nie ma obiektywnej prawdy, są tylko narracje. A skoro tak, to najlepiej usiąść na dupie i nic nie robić. A gdy usiądziesz, to ci, którzy zamiast uprawiać zwykłą politykę, chcą okraść Cię z państwa, będą mogli to robić bez przeszkód. A że w budowaniu narracji to oni są akurat najlepsi, to jeszcze będziesz przekonany, że mają rację. Powyższe dwa zdanie nieźle opisują znaczną część elektoratu Partii. Przecież Prezes i Ziobro wprost im mówią: “przejmiemy sądy, nie będziecie mieli uczciwych i niezależnych sądów, sędziowie będą nasi, będą kryli nasze przestępstwa i pomogą nam rządzić wiecznie” - a jakaś ¼ Polaków bije temu brawo, bo sprytni macherzy od PR-u dobrze dobrali przekaz, umieścili w nim odpowiednio dużo “postkomunizmu”, “przywracania godności” i “zepsutych elit”, by ludziom ta opowieść podobała się bardziej od tej o niezależności sądownictwa i trójpodziale władzy. Wiecie, tej nudnej, z WOS-u.

👉 Ale czemu oni to robią? Wszak, mimo wszystko, politykom w każdym kraju zdarza się kłamać, czasem wręcz bezczelnie. Ale większość z nich jednak nie odrzuca samej idei obiektywnej prawdy. Mogą ukrywać fakty, przedstawiać je w korzystny sposób, budować na nich mało spójne teorie, ale jednak zgadzają się, wszyscy się zgadzamy, że gdzieś pod spodem jest jakaś Prawda. Tymczasem autokraci odrzucają samą prawdę. Różnica polega na tym, że normalni politycy w demokratycznych krajach, operują w granicach zapisanego prawa, grają według reguł funkcjonowania państwa (dokładnie na tym polega idea praworządności, którą Partia tak ochoczo odrzuca). Tymczasem autokrata chce zburzyć system i rządzić wiecznie. W tym celu musi posuwać się do “dużych kłamstw”. I nie może kłamać czasem, tylko cały czas, bo samo jądro sposobu jego rządzenia jest oparte na konieczności łamania prawa. Ale gdyby taki autokrata tylko kłamał, to szybciutko wyszłoby to na jaw, bo byłby każdego dnia punktowany przez niezależne media i instytucje, takie jak sądy, czy prokuratura.

👉 Znacznie lepsze rezultaty przynosi z kolei odrzucenie prawdy jako takiej. Zwróćcie uwagę, że Ziobro z nikim się nie kłóci na przykład o to, ilu polskich sędziów rzeczywiście jest “skażonych PRL-em”. Nie. On po prostu buduje opowieść, że polski wymiar sprawiedliwości to postkomunistyczna kasta (to jest to “duże kłamstwo”), z czego wynika, że postkomuniści rządzą całym krajem, postkomunistyczne są wszystkie elity, którym zdeprawowani za Jaruzelskiego sędziowie gwarantują bezkarność. Gdy ktoś udowadnia, że przeciętny polski sędzia jest przed 50-tką, że ci, którzy załapali się zawodowo na PRL to jakiś ułamek, Ziobro przedstawia to jako kontropowieść. Po prostu inne zdanie, nie opis rzeczywistości. Z rzeczywistością ciężko się kłócić. Z innym zdaniem można się kłócić do upadłego. Drugi konkurs: kto z Was jest tak na serio na bieżąco z całą rozgrywką Partii z sędziami? Prawie nikt, prawda? Ja ten temat śledzę w miarę dokładnie, a i tak za prawie każdym razem muszę sobie przypominać od nowa o co chodziło, kto kogo dyscyplinuje za co, który wyrok jest kwestionowany, która ustawa była nielegalna. To co ma myśleć statystyczny wyborca? Nic. Ma nie myśleć, tylko machnąć na to ręką i pozwolić Ziobrze działać dalej.

👉 Nie jest przypadkiem, że rosyjskie trolle i cała kremlowska propaganda, mocno angażują się nie tylko w przedstawianie swojej wersji świata, ale także w odrzucanie samej idei, że świat da się obiektywnie przedstawić. Puszczanie w obieg sprzecznych informacji jest nie tylko dopuszczalne, ale wręcz wskazane. Ruskie trolle mówią na przykład skrajnej prawicy na Zachodzie, że Ukrainą rządzą Żydzi, bo Zełeński jest z żydowskiej rodziny. Te same trolle (możliwe, że z innego piętra Fabryki Trolli Prigożyna) mówią lewicy, że Ukrainą rządzą neonaziści. Polakom mówi się, że Ukraińcy genetycznie nienawidzą Polaków, bo Wołyń. Węgrom, że Węgrów, bo Trianon. Ukraina jest jednocześnie państwem upadłym i sprawnym totalitaryzmem. NATO prowadzi z Rosją wojnę, ale równocześnie dopiero chce w tę wojnę wciągnąć swoich członków, na przykład Polskę. Ruskie trolle mówiły Amerykanom w 2016 roku, że Hillary Clinton to lewaczka, która chce zalać USA czarnoskórymi imigrantami. Chyba, że mówili do czarnoskórych wyborców - wtedy mówiono, że to przedstawicielka rasistowskiego establishmentu. Biedakom mówiono, że Clinton jest z obrzydliwie bogatych elit. Elitom, że to komunistka. Wszystkie te narracje nawzajem się wykluczają. I o to właśnie chodzi.

👉 Nie jest też przypadkiem, że Partia stosuje tę technikę, którą Piknik na skraju głupoty nazywa “wielonarracją”, cały czas. Prezes jeździ teraz po kraju i co chwila daje sprzeczny komunikat. Za wszelkie zło odpowiadają Niemcy. Albo Platforma, czyli jednak Polacy. Albo Bruksela, czyli wszyscy Europejczycy. Albo elgiebety, czyli jednak niektórzy europejczycy. Albo sędziowie, czyli niektórzy Polacy. Unia jest lewackim eksperymentem feministek, ale zachowuje się wobec Polski po faszystowsku. Pieniądze z KPO? Proszę bardzo. Potrzebujemy ich, ale jednak nie, to dużo, ale jednak mało, stać nas by ich nie mieć, ale jednak nie, jesteśmy gotowi na ustępstwa, ale nie sprzedamy suwerenności za garść srebrników, poszliśmy na ustępstwa, ale jednak stoimy twardo przy swoim, z UE chcemy rozmawiać, ale jednak “koniec tego dobrego”. Idealnym przykładem jest macierewiczowa dezinformacja wokół Smoleńska, gdzie naliczono bodaj 30 całkowicie sprzecznych teorii, z których większość zaprzeczała prawom fizyki. Jaka jest prawda? W tym świecie jest to pytanie bezzasadne. Właściwe brzmi: “po co Ci w ogóle prawda?”

👉 Stąd pojawiło się zjawisko symetryzmu, które jest rakiem debaty publicznej w każdym kraju. Stąd mamy ludzi, nie mówię tu o oczywistych płatnych trollach, którzy dla własnego spokoju ducha zrównują stojące po jednej stronie fakty, z budowanym w kontrze do nich narracjami i mówią rzeczy w stylu “kto wie, ci mówią tak, tamci inaczej, prawda leży po środku, pewnie znowu kłócą się o pieniądze”. Władcy tacy jak Prezes, Ziobro, Trump, Orban, Erdogan, a w wypadkach skrajnych Putin czy Xi Jinping, kochają takich ludzi, bo takimi ludźmi się bardzo prosto rządzi. Bowiem nie trzeba im nic tłumaczyć czy obiecywać, a także z niczego się przed nimi rozliczać. Wystarczy dać im dobry show. Taki, który lepiej zagra na ich emocjach. A Prezesi i Putinowie tego świata są w to zawsze lepsi od demokratów, bo robią taki show cały czas.

👉 “Wszyscy kradną, ale ci się dzielą” - mówimy o stereotypowym poglądzie wyborców Partii. Ale z pewnością macie znajomych i członków rodzin, którzy niekoniecznie kochają Partię, ale też już mają dość, pogubili się w tych niekończących się bataliach o TK, Sąd Najwyższy, KPO, niezależność sędziów, KRS itd., chcą już tylko spokoju, żeby ktoś już to zakończył i dał im zająć się swoimi sprawami. I wtedy na scenę wjeżdżają ci wszyscy watażkowie, którzy - to również element show - potrafią świetnie przedstawiać się jako jedyni sprawiedliwi, szeryfowie, którzy zaprowadzą porządek. Dlatego Trump obiecywał “osuszenie bagna”, Prezes “powstanie z kolan”, “przywrócenie godności” i “suwerenność”, Ziobro “zniszczenie uprzywilejowanej kasty”, Putin odrzucenie “jednobiegunowego świata” i “zachodniego imperializmu” itd. Nikt z nich nic z tego nie zrobił. Ale te obietnice są nadal atrakcyjne dla ludzi, którzy chcą prostych odpowiedzi na skomplikowane problemy. I im bardziej są oderwani od rzeczywistości, im bardziej zamykają oczy na fakty i odmawiają spokojnej ich analizy, tym chętniej uwierzą w takie baśniowe, ale bardzo wygodne psychologicznie, obietnice.

👉 Przyznam, że w całym zakłamaniu Partii, ten gwałt na intelekcie irytuje mnie najbardziej. A już zupełnie wkurwia mnie świadomość, że nawet gdy Partia odejdzie i sobie swoją głupią twarz rozwali, zostaną z nami miliony ludzi, których Prezes z Ziobrą zmienili już w totalnych nihilistów. Partia zniknie, oni będą, prawdopodobnie dalej przekonani, że wszyscy kłamią, nie ma prawdy, wartości to iluzja, nikomu nie można ufać. Aż ich zagospodaruje jakiś nowy klon Prezesa. Często pytacie mnie w komentarzach i wiadomościach “co robić?”. Cóż, zacząłbym od dotarcia do tych znajomych.

Kwestie nuklearne - nuki Rosji i ataki na elektrownie jądrowe,"Dobry.

Dzisiaj dyskutowałem z kolegą zza granicy powyższe tematy. Tematy, które siedzą pewnie w głowach wielu osób. Kolega jest z kraju, który chyba jak żaden inny doświadczył kwestii nuklearnych - Japonia.

Z dyskusji wyłoniły się dwie kwestie, którymi chcę się podzielić, w skrócie:

1. Atak na elektrownię jądrową, jakkolwiek brzmi strasznie, nie jest aż tak niebezpieczny jak wiele osób myśli. Elektrownie atomowe projektowane są tak by móc wytrzymać bez większych problemów scenariusz z World Trade Center - czyli spadający samolot. Jest to info, które zasłyszałem od Jarosława Wolskiego, jednego z ludzi piszących do magazynu Nowa Technika Wojskowa (źródło: [https://youtu.be/PD0GFV0s5Rg?t=2622](https://youtu.be/PD0GFV0s5Rg?t=2622)). Kolega z Japonii to potwierdza. Trzeba się baaardzo postarać, żeby przebić obudowę bezpieczeństwa w takiej elektrowni.  Dobrze jest też nie panikować i śledzić komunikaty, np. te wydawane przez Państwowa Agencję Atomistyki:  [https://www.gov.pl/web/paa/minister-anna-moskwa-nie-ma-zagrozenia-w-zwiazku-z-sytuacja-w-elektrowni-jadrowej-zaporoze](https://www.gov.pl/web/paa/minister-anna-moskwa-nie-ma-zagrozenia-w-zwiazku-z-sytuacja-w-elektrowni-jadrowej-zaporoze)
2. W rozmowie pojawił się też artykuł: [https://globalsecurityreview.com/nuclear-de-escalation-russias-deterrence-strategy/](https://globalsecurityreview.com/nuclear-de-escalation-russias-deterrence-strategy/) Tutaj już nie jest tak różowo i pewnie jest to powód, dla którego Polska nie przekaże własnych MIGów, a państwa NATO jakkolwiek wspierają Ukrainę militarnie, to same nie poślą tam swoich żołnierzy. Poniżej wycinek przetłumaczony z artykułu:

>*Przed zakończeniem operacji NATO w Kosowie Rosja zainicjowała opracowanie nowej doktryny wojskowej, która miała odstraszyć jakikolwiek* ***konwencjonalny*** *lub nuklearny atak na Rosję. Za nadzór nad tym przedsięwzięciem odpowiadał ówczesny sekretarz Rady Bezpieczeństwa FR Władimir Putin. Tak się złożyło, że to Putin podpisał tę doktrynę po jej wydaniu w 2000 roku, będąc świeżo zaprzysiężonym prezydentem. Deeskalacja zmienia skalę możliwego uderzenia nuklearnego. Podczas gdy odstraszanie w okresie zimnej wojny opierało się na groźbie wyrządzenia przytłaczających szkód wrogim celom wojskowym i cywilnym, deeskalacja opiera się na koncepcji „uszkodzeń punktowych”. Doktryna definiuje „szkody punktowe” jako zadawanie „szkody subiektywnie nie do zaakceptowania dla przeciwnika \[i\] przekraczającej korzyści, które \[przeciwnik\] spodziewa się uzyskać w wyniku użycia \[****konwencjonalnej****\] siły militarnej”. Innymi słowy, rosyjscy planiści wojskowi wierzyli, że groźba ograniczonego lub taktycznego uderzenia nuklearnego na cele wroga będzie skutecznym odstraszaniem przed* ***konwencjonalnym*** *atakiem Stanów Zjednoczonych lub NATO.*

Podkreślam to słowo, bo w artykule pada wiele razy. Rosja jest w stanie użyć deeskalacyjnie nuków przy konwencjonalnych i nie nuklearnych atakach. Ponieważ tak zdefiniowali swoją doktrynę wojenną to widać, że Biden i zachód robi wszystko by ją obejść i nie doprowadzić do sprawdzenia czy jest to blef czy nie. Te nagromadzanie wojsk pod granicą już zostało wytestowane, trwało długo, nikt z tym nic nie robił  - jednak nie były to ćwiczenia wojskowe...

Także może teraz pojawi się więcej zrozumienia, dlaczego zachód tak mało (albo i nie) robi w kwestii Ukrainy. To dlatego są to: sankcje, ataki hakerskie, dostarczanie broni i informacji wywiadowczych Ukraińcom i każdy próbuje obejść temat pomagania bezpośredniego szerokim łukiem. Zachód gra na to, żeby to Ukraińcy wygrali potyczkę z Rosją albo całość skończyło się jakimś ""remisem"".  Także nie nastraja to pozytywnie -  najprawdopodobniej będzie to długi konflikt na wyniszczenie.

Mam tylko nadzieję, że nikt nie zmieni definicji tego co jest rozumiane jako ten konwencjonalny atak...

Pozostaje pytanie: jak mogłoby wyglądać takie deeskalacyjne użycie broni atomowej, gdy Kreml poczuje się zbyt przyparty do muru? **Podkreślam od razu - spekuluję.** Wydaje mi się, że najpierw zostałby wybrany jakiś cel ""dla przykładu"", na Ukrainie, żeby pokazać, że Rosja nie żartuje. Patrząc na bliskość Rosji z Ukrainą - raczej możliwie daleko od ich granic. Myślę, że Rosja jest absolutnie świadoma, że użycie broni na państwach NATO skutkowało by odpaleniem artykułu 5. i oznaczało kłopoty dla nich... I właśnie tak oto mamy taką ""proxy wojnę"", czyli konflikt toczony na terytorium zastępczym. Znów można by pewnie polemizować, że możliwe, iż będzie to konflikt taki jak ten z Afganistanu, Syrii czy Wietnamu. Kraje te nie były objęte odpowiednimi protekcjami i dlatego dochodzi do starcia ""mocarstw"", kosztem ludzi i ich terytorium. Jest to smutne i niepokojące.

Oczywiście uważam, że to Ukraina prowadzi działania w słusznej sprawie. To Putin ma jakieś chore jazdy i jego historyczne wykłady o tym, że Ukraina nie zasługuje na państwowość, a kraj jest zarządzany przez nazioli, dla mnie nie trzyma się kupy i jest to tylko BS pretekst, żeby zrobić to co chciał - dokonać pełnoskalowej inwazji i budować ZSRR.

"Mój rant o kwestii gotowania żab, a ekstremizacji ruskich onuce","Aktualnie w polskim Internecie istnieje wojna domowa, gdzie każdy każdego oskarża o działania na rzecz Rosji. Zapewne to zauważyliście, ale czy zadaliście sobie pytanie skąd u nas tyle osób, które popiera Rosję albo jest przeciwko wsparciu dla Ukrainy? Jak dochodzi do tego, że Polak czujący się patriotą nagle zaczyna popierać naród, który chciał polskość zniszczyć (patrz Katyń)?

Według mnie większość z nich ani nie popierało wcześniej Rosji ani nie dostaje za to złamanego rubla. Zostali wygotowanie jak żaby. A jak się gotuje żaby? Powoli i na małym ogniu, bo inaczej szok termiczny sprawi, że uciekną, ale jeżeli temperaturę zwiększamy bardzo powoli to żaba nawet nie zauważy, że jest gotowana.

Od dłuższego czasu mówi się, że duża cześć fanpagy/blogów w Polsce i na świecie jest prowadzona przez obce wywiady. Zaczyna się niewinnie i od prawdy:

Na stronach dla przeciwników szczepień wskazują na bezsens niektórych zasad wprowadzonych w pandemię.

Na stronach dla narodowców mówią o pomocy Polakom na kresach, o pamięci o poległych

Na stronach dla liberałów o tym, że w Polsce trzeba zmian 

Są i strony dla uczniów, pań domu i czego sobie nie wymarzycie.

Potem odklejają się coraz bardziej, ale nadal powoli wrzucą jakiś śmieszny mem: że UE głupie, że w Rosji/Chinach czy skąd akurat piszą jest pod jakimś względem fajnie. A Ty coraz bardziej w to wierzysz, bo czemu masz nie wierzyć? Do tej pory mówili prawdę to teraz też mówią. I tu właśnie zaczyna się gotowanie. Mały ogień powoli gotuje twój mózg jak żabę. Ale przedstawione wydarzenia są prawdziwe, pokazane tylko z tej strony by cię zekstremizować, byle pierdoły wyniesione do n-tej potęgi:

Gej okradziony gdzieś pod Warszawą? To musi być napad prawicowych bojówek! Musisz się bronić!

Polka postrzelona w Szwecji? To przez tych Arabów! Unia chce Ci ich wcisnąć! Musisz się bronić!

Do tej pory nie kłamali, sprawdzasz czy te rzeczy się zdarzyły. Jasne, że się zdarzyły więc reszta zdania musi być prawdziwa. Tak działa ludzki mózg.

Nie ukrywajmy - Putina najbardziej interesuje prawa prawica, bo są mu i jego wizji świata najbliżsi. Już od jakiegoś czasu zbrodnie Ukraińców na Polakach zaczęły być im przedstawiane jako najważniejsze i najgorsze w historii. Już widzę wśród niektórych znajomych przebąkiwania o tym, że nie powinniśmy pomagać Ukraińcom - bo Wołyń, co dla mnie jest zabawne, bo powinni tą samą logiką popierać pomaganie w walce z Rosją - bo Katyń. 

Ale o drugą stronę też dbają i nagle najważniejsze są osoby ciemnoskóre na granicy (zarówno obserwatorzy z UE jak i dziennikarze na miejscu, o których wiem nie potwierdzili, że systemowo się nie przepuszcza Hindusów itp.) Ale pojedyncze przypadki rasizmu się zdarzyły. Przez polsko ukraińskie granice przeszło już blisko pół miliona ludzi uciekających przed wojną w takiej masie będą zawsze przypadki przestępstw. Piszą też że osoby transseksualne są źle traktowane na Ukrainie. Dlaczego te tematy stały się nagle ważne? Bo lewa strona sceny politycznej nie musi Rosji popierać wystarczy, że nie jest przeciwko. Patrząc na „zachodnie” reddity i media to w pewnym procencie działa.

I tak o to stajemy się „pożytecznymi idiotami” wygotowani jak żaba. Dlatego ważne jest żeby nie czerpać informacji tylko z jednych źródeł i pamiętać że „Ludzie są podli ale człowiek jest zazwyczaj dobry”. A i jak myślisz że to gotowanie mózgu na ciebie nie działa albo że tym bardziej działa na osoby o przeciwnych poglądach, to zastanów się czy przypadkiem i ciebie ktoś nie urabia teraz.

Jestem dumny z Polski. W tej trudnej sytuacji, w której znalazła się Polska i Ukraina - ludzie którzy wcześniej byli podzieleni, w większości odrzucili pranie mózgów i okazali człowieczeństwo.

A tekst napisałem pod wpływem dalszego znajomego, który z osoby progresywnej zaczął najpierw wrzucać o tym że jego firma ucierpiała przez pandemię.

Wstyd,"Oprócz uczucia wkurwu na Rosję itd uczuciem, które u mnie dominuje to wstyd. 

Mam znajomych spoza kontynentu, z Japonii. Dzwonią ew. piszą jak tam u nas, że widać jak Polska pięknie pomaga w TV i że Rosja jest do dupy. Generalnie fajnie i miło. 

Tyle, ja się uważam za Europejczyka. Dla mnie to jest ogromny wstyd, że jako kontynent zachowujemy się jak najgorsze zakątki świata. Mimo tego, że Unia Europejska jako taka powstała, żeby na naszym kontynencie nie było wojen to jednak jest, znowu i to wielka, z bombardowaniami szpitali i umierającymi dziećmi. Wiem, że ani Rosja ani Ukraina do Unii nie należą a mimo to czuję wstyd, że obok dzieją się rzeczy, które nie powinny dziać się nigdzie i którym moim zdaniem, jako Europejczycy mogliśmy zapobiec, gdyby nie pazerność i marazm.
