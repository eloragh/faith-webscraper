### This is for your thesis!

The only file you need to look at is [the excel file](ukrainian_migration_to_poland_data.xlsx). It's large so you'll need to download it.

You can look at the python file if you want! But they might not make any sense.

They barely make sense to me.

Here are the terms I used to search each subreddit:

```python
subreddits_queries = {
    "poland": [
        "ukrainian",
        "ukraine",
        "ukrainians in poland", 
        "ukrainian migration", 
        "ukrainian asylum", 
        "poland refugees", 
        "poland border crisis"
    ],
    "polska": [
        "ukraina",
        "ukraina uchodźcy", 
        "ukraińscy uchodźcy", 
        "uchodźcy w polsce", 
        "migracja ukraina", 
        "granica polska ukraina"
    ]
}
```

I hope this helps!!! We all love you <3
