### This is for your thesis!

The only file you need to look at is [the excel file](multi_subreddit_ukrainian_refugee_sentiment.xlsx). It's large so you'll need to download it.

You can look at the python files if you want! They don't bite :) but they might not make any sense.

Here are the terms I used to search each subreddit

```python
subreddits_queries = {
    "poland": [
        "Ukrainian refugees", 
        "Ukrainians in Poland", 
        "Ukrainian migration", 
        "Ukrainian asylum", 
        "Poland refugees", 
        "Poland border crisis"
    ],
    "polska": [
        "Ukraina uchodźcy", 
        "ukraińscy uchodźcy", 
        "uchodźcy w Polsce", 
        "migracja Ukraina", 
        "granica Polska Ukraina"
    ],
    "polish": [
        "Ukrainian migration", 
        "Polish language refugees", 
        "learning Polish as refugee", 
        "Ukrainian asylum in Poland"
    ]
}
```

They barely make sense to me.

I hope this helps!!! We all love you <3
